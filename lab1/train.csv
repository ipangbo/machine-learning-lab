1829,Ted's Frostop,29.947026,-90.113604,17.0,"Breakfast here is great and there's never a huge wait. The place has the feel of old time diner. The menu is basic, but portions are generous and prices are low - eggs any style, bacon, grits, home fries, biscuits and pancakes. The pancakes here are delicious! Outside texture is a little crispy. Inside they're a tiny bit sweet and unlike any others I've had. Their biscuits are buttery and decadent. I usually get the Early Bird (2 eggs, bacon, grits, and pancakes). Try their root beer too.",Restaurants

These guys are between the McDonalds and the old Pizza Hut on Claiborne, I got carry out for the first time from there and wow it was good. They are not dripping grease like most cheese steaks and the bread is great. Many times the sub rolls on cheese staks are huge and you end up with too much bread, not the case here. WARNING, they spice their meat and it has a bit of kick. Definately give these guys a shot if you are in the area.",Restaurants

My husband had the blackened alligator as an app and I had the crab and corn bisque - both great. Highly recommend getting blackened instead of fried... unless you just don't like blackened seasoning.  I had the shrimp po' boy and he had the red fish for our mains. I should have ordered something a little more specialized - save the po' boy for a more basic place! They do a great job with flavoring and there's a lot of great options on the menu. Worth a visit!",Restaurants

Most reviews are correct, the quality is subpar, but lets be honest...you get what you pay for. Wish is a great place to get that ""one time"" outfit you need and will most likely not wear again.

The garlic and chipotle flavors were the best.  The little tiny tabasco bottles were awesome little souvenirs for people at home as a joke.

1325,French Quarter Grill,29.959478,-90.061063,3.5,"I couldn't figure out whether to add this review under Mississippi River Bottoms bar because it's located at the same address.  It's run independently, though; or so I was told.  French Quarter Grill is only reachable by walking through MRB bar and into the courtyard.   According to the gentleman who took my order, FQG is run separately even though it's only accessible via the bar.  Weird.  To further highlight that,  I was told I would need to get my own drink at the bar, pay for it there, and then bring it into the courtyard where I could then give them my food order and pay for it separately.    Aside from being a little confusing for a novice visitor (like me), I like this place.  I liked the bar, too, it was dive-y and down to earth, although I didn't spend any real time in it.  The courtyard is pretty small, shaded in parts, with only a few tables available.   The food is okay, reasonably priced, and served quickly.  The owner's three-legged dog kept me company for a few moments, staring at me while I ate my crawfish, but I was advised not to feed him table scraps as in true dog fashion, he would start sitting at the table with everyone eating outside.  They didn't want him to start that habit.    I enjoyed this place.  I'd definitely come back here in lieu of the nearby busier tourist traps.   French Quarter Grill is a cash only place, so come prepared.",Restaurants

My son is obsessed with opossums so we were beyond excited to see that they love them as well! Not a opossum fan? They have ALL sorts of cute designs! We were quick to order a Mardi Gras opossum shirt which they would easily ship to our home. After little opossum talk, we went on our way! Once home, I added them on social media and saw that they also had a new opossum Mardi Gras shirt! They offered to switch designs without me even asking. Due to a mix up, the original design was shipped and before it even arrived, I received a message informing me of the mix up and assuring me that the correct one would also be sent and to keep both as a token of appreciation. Now that's customer service and I literally have the happiest 3 year old in the history of toddlers!

It seems to be holding up well so far.   The only disappointing thing I experienced when I was in the store was that everything I wanted was out of stock. I could have bought more, but I felt like none of the shoes in my size were in stock, along with the dog leash, etc. Although I could wait for it to get back in stock in their online store (since I don't live in New Orleans), it's not exactly the same because I like to see and touch it in person if I'm in the store.",Shopping

Didn't get the best service while I was there, but the guy did seem to be on a business call, and sometimes those things can't wait. Overall, I liked their selection, but a lot of it was either identical or very similar to the selection at Nadeau and was, at least, 40% more expensive than Nadeau.  Bottom line- It's all beautiful and, if you live in the area and need the convenience, this is the only place I'd shop.

Having said that if any one out there feels compelled not to be a patron of an establishment who's owner believes that its ok to shout out derogatory comments in regards to race and ethnicity well read on ..   I visited Samuel's Blind Pelican on Oct. 13th during their happy hour. The Chard Oysters where good only complain could be the sandy crunchy taste at the end. The bartender was great..! she was very attentive. I ended up staying till the first quarter of the Monday night game.   My unfortunate encounter with the Pelican's owner happen the following thursday after visiting the neighboring restaurant. The Pelicans owner stood on the side walk 10 feet from where i was having lunch. He called the city to inquire if the restaurant (tacos and beer) had acquired the proper permits to have a TV on the front patio. He began to spew derogatory comments and racial slurs about the current owners to a buddy of his. Loud enough for all to hear. I was actually shocked and was lost for words.  He then looked at me and made a comment. I believe he thought i was an employee of the restaurant. Once he did, I couldn't help but to say something. It was awful what came out this mans mouth. He continued to shout racial comments from the steps of his restaurant to the Tacos and Beer owner. The cops where called. I was asked by the restaurant if i would stay to speak to the officers.    What makes me sick to my stomach is to know that i was also a patron of this establishment. I can not believe that there are people out there who still believe is fine to use use such derogatory comments in regards to race. He had no care of those around him. The Officers asked me if i was willing to press charges against the Pelicans owner for disturbing the peace. He was also told by officers that after that rant he could be charged for a hate crime against the neighboring restaurant for calling the city and heckling their clientele.   no one should condone the use of race or ethnicity as a shortcoming...",Restaurants

Catahoula offers cocktails you may not find anywhere else in NOLA with its Peruvian influences. Though the cocktails are still rather expensive even during the happy hour compared to other happy hours the fact that they are not your typical sazerac makes up for it. The food menu is pretty good for happy hour with half price off appetizers. The star of the show is the upstairs rooftop bar.

AnyWHO, on opening day, in the drive thru, I found the cashiers to be efficient, friendly (speaking to my 11month old niece), timely &  swift in their transactions. I placed two separate food orders, one for my granny & my sister.   Pricing was fair, you can get a whole meal &  drink for less than $7; one of those 3 chicken fingers deals; that's cool, I've become so accustomed to $10+ for fast food meals until I was pleasantly surprised at this event.   The lemonade is very tasty &  since I only got a sip of my sister's, I vowed to return for my own.   As stated, the drive thru line moved rather swiftly considering this was the 1st day; I was impressed.

We all ordered combination dinners which came with the entree, soup, egg roll and fried rice. The prices were around 10 dollars so a sweet price for all the food.   Some things that were ordered were:  Shrimp with garlic  sauce. This had a great taste and was not fried and came with vegetables also.   Shrimp with lobster sauce.  The shrimp was sautéed and not fried with this dish. This can in a deep dish and was the consistency of a gumbo. It was good but I would not order again because I wasn't into the soupy gumbo type dish.   Mandarin chicken was fried and had some kind of sauce on the top. The sauce wasn't sweet not spicy.

I live just outside the city now, but was in for a convention and my co-workers and I stopped in to La Cote as a last resort for lunch.  It's at a hotel, it looks generic-trendy, two things that usually mean bad, over-priced food.  Thats not the case at all.  The menu is full of real Louisiana food, each dish sounding more delicious than the next.  My co-worker got a shrimp po-boy that was so over stuffed with fried shrimp that she ate it with a fork.  The shrimp tasted sweet, like they were fresh from the gulf.  Another co-worker got the glazed salmon, which looked ridiculous and she gasped it was so good.  As for me, I got the roasted beet and goat cheese salad (yes not LA cuisine) and as the waitress said that the seafood stew was her favorite, that as well.  The stew came in its own tiny cast iron pot, that looked too small for my appetite, but every bite was full of sweet crab, crawfish, shrimp and the fantastic broth.  It was seriously delicious.  The salad had thick beet slices, goat cheese and arugula placed in a tower so when I cut into it i got a bit of all three.  The beet was soft, sweet, and in perfect ratio to the cheese and arugula.  The one fault I can find is that were some yellowing arugula on the plate, but arugula's so delicate that's understandable.  It was a fantastic salad none the less.  One thing that was unique about this place was the servers (it was lunch) were all women of color.  In a city dominated by white men in that position, that's really incredible.

Getting an order of those avocados was one of the best decisions I ever made in my life. I want a deep fryer at home just to make these.  Coming from Portland, these tacos are a little expensive compared to what I'm used to, but they are totally worth the extra couple dollars. And the guy in the kitchen was so accommodating to our group. Thumbs up. Can't wait to go back.",Restaurants

My stepdad I went he had the Guiness sausage hotdog and I had the crawfish étouffée hotdog and we both shared bacon and cheese fries. Oh my gosh the hotdogs were simply amazing I mean, hotdogs are already good, but for them to mix it up in so many different varieties was the icing on the cake.

So if I were a Mom or had an epic sweet tooth or liked worked out gear, I think I'd be more about this stock. I wish they had more crafting, gift wrapping, storage, and items that would be useful for work.   On some items, it made sense for it to be $5 and others it just didn't. I'm sure I'll go back again.

3482,Cibugnù,29.9472121,-90.0715342,1.0,"Living in the neighborhood, I had suspicious about this place as their neighbors on each side are always packed, and Cibugnu is often empty.   Let me start by saying the food was OK - not the best, but certainly decent.   My reason for a 2 start review was due to service. To start, when I went to order wine by the glass, they were out of my first two selections (they maybe sell 4 wines by the glass). The waitress told me that I should opt for an alternative, that was approximately $6 more by the glass. I should have asked, but I assumed she would have charged me the lower price considering they were out of the wine I requested. It was kind of tacky - not the diners fault your lower price point items are out of stock, if anything she should have been upfront about this when we told her we'd be drinking wine by the glass that evening.   secondly, I was on the phone describing to my sister where the restaurant was so she could meet us, and the waitress overheard me (mis)pronouncing the restaurant name - and she walked over to me, and correctly pronounced the name in my ear (while i was on the phone!). I think she was trying to be helpful, but it was extremely rude and awkward. Who wants their waitress whispering in their ear while they are on the phone? It also came across as condescending. She should have stopped by later and informed me on the correct pronunciation.  overall, the experience just gave me a bad vibe, especially when there is another Italian spot right next door. pass.",Restaurants
2582,CVS pharmacy,29.9405502861,-90.1038508556,17.0,"This is the typical CVS that has those little convince things you may suddenly need like dish soap but the prices reflect the convince. Overall this is not a bad store, they always greet you when you walk in 'welcome to CVS' but I think this is a company policy not something that is store specific.   Something I like about this place (and CVS in general) is the coupons they give you on your receipts and how you can earn points for purchases over time that can be converted in to 'cash' by reducing your total when you decide to use your points.   One final note is that if you come in the morning right after they open there will be carts and boxes covered in cling wrap full of merchandise everywhere, some stacked almost to the ceiling. I don't know if I'm just lucky and have gone there early several times on whatever day they get their deliveries but it seems like they could be a little more organized. I've seen boxes and random trash everywhere etc. I know they have to do what they have to do and that the merchandise does not just magically replenish itself but to me how they go about making that happen just seems messy and lazy.  That being said, because I live close and there will always be times when I need something random on the quick and don't want to venture to the 9th circle of Wal-Mart hell, I will be back with out a doubt.",Shopping

3341,Palm Room Diamond Lounge At Harrahs,29.949609106,-90.0646672017,1.0,"The Diamond lounge at Harrah's New Orleans is not labeled as such and it is not the easiest place to find.  It is actually called the Palm Room and it is located in the back of the high limit tables area.  It could easily be mistaken for a lounge where high limit gaming goes on.  I have been to the casino four different times and this was actually my first time stopping at the lounge since it never really stood out before.  Plus there really isn't a need to go to the lounge which is what makes it unique.  But, before I get to that I will give you a quick rundown of the lounge's offering.  The set up inside is on the smaller side and when I stopped in there on Sunday evening it was pretty full.  The room has dark wood throughout and a small bar area with a few seats.  Most of the seating is at regular tables though.  There was a small buffet with a decent selection of hot items, although I think they sometimes have a small menu to order off of.  The buffet had chicken noodle soup, potato salad, pulled pork, baked beans, dinner rolls, and an assortment of cookies.  It was a better spread than you see in the Las Vegas lounges most of the time.  Drink policy!!!  The drink policy is what sets Harrah's New Orleans apart from the other Total Rewards locations, and it is an improvement in my opinion.  When you are at the lounge you are told that you are limited to 4 drinks per day as a Diamond member. Seven Stars members are limited to 8 drinks per day.  That sounds punitive since Las Vegas and Atlantic City give you unlimited drinks in the lounge everyday.  What makes this policy unique is that you can get those 4 drinks at pretty much any bar in the casino. That includes the awesome steakhouse!  You are limited to drinks $15 and under. That is up to $60 in value per day for Diamond card holders, $120 for Seven Star card holders.  This lounge is great!! I recommend it highly if your visiting!!!",Restaurants

The sushi was the worst I've ever had; in fact I've had better from a supermarket. The sushi rice was overcooked and the rolls just had no flavor. The hamburger and coleslaw were mediocre.

The menu looked divine. This restaurant being great to share, hence to taste more meals, we ordered 4 different meals and shared: the cheese-filled okra, the New Orleans casserole, the farmer salad and the Vietnamese crepe. All tasted delicious and we could have easily eaten two portions each. When we received the dessert menu we weren't hungry any longer. It looked less interesting than the savory menu.

I say head on over for a night of dancing, it's worth it!  A great plus of this place is that everyone is so busy dancing that they don't have time to smoke- you can breathe in here!   The music is an eclectic mix of current rap/r&b, pop, and then some 80s/90s stuff. I actually heard a few wedding line dance type songs. F&M is actually a few different rooms all connected and last night they were playing different music in the different rooms. The bar was servings up wings and cheese fries and all types of things that smelled great.   I heard from a local that no one ends up here unless it's way into the early morning hours and they've had too much to drink.   I guess I don't understand why people are complaining about the scene here. Are you going out to pick up a new date? Or are you going out with your friends to dance and spend time together? Okay, so a few guys made some comments- just shake them off or smile and walk away! Maybe this isn't the place to meet new people...but I had fun.

Once you find a place you like sit and enjoy.   My friends and I ate at one of the Honduran places. Their Carne Asada plates look amazing and were a full serving even for the biggest eater.

2192,Taceaux Loceaux,29.916559,-90.1181586,2.0,"I really wanted tacos for dinner, and this truck satisfied the need! We caught it at dos jefes bar uptown New Orleans near Tchoup and Joseph. There was a bit of a line, and the only reason that I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the lack of communication between the chefs and the customers. Instead of letting me know they would be with me after they finished a line of orders, they kept their backs to the line and didn't say anything for a good 8 minutes.  The food is outstanding. My friends and I had the Seoul Man chicken, the Brisket, and the Hermit. All the meats were so juicy and flavorful, and the on-top combinations are awesome. Great kick, and they line the bottom of the trays with jalapenos for a little extra spice. You get two good sized tacos per order for 6-7$. I had one order and felt satisfied, and I took one to go.   The calas, fried rice cakes with a sweet dipping sauce, are really delicious and a great buy at 3$.  Will definitely return often.",Restaurants

We barely had room to get into the chairs and I had to ask the table behind us to move so I could squeeze in.  The menu was small, but decent selection.  They did offer a discount on alcohol beverages, but we were not feeling it after our Friday night on the town.  We got and order of mole chicken tostadas and chorizo queso dip to share.  The tostadas came out first, which was odd.  They were very good.  Sweet with a little heat in the back end.  Kind of a small portion for the price though.  The queso was interesting.  A small dollop of chorizo on top of the queso, which was grainy.  The it tasted good, but the mouth feel was like eating raw ricotta.  The chips were fresh and plentiful.

Admittedly, we haven't found a lot of good Mexican restaurants in Uptown.  Go figure.    We order mostly the fish tacos which are respectable.  In fact, it's the only taco that we have liked from Taqueria Corona.  The carne asada is pretty pathetic.  The tortilla is decent, so they are halfway there.  But the meat is dry and not well seasoned.  So the saving grace of TC is their fish tacos.  My cousin who recommended the place told me not to waste my time with anything but the fish tacos.  He's an idiot, so of course I ordered other stuff.  Turns out he is a genius.  Only the fish tacos are good. And they are just good, not killer.  They have a respectable few thick pieces of unknown fish lightly battered and served under a spicy tarter sauce.  I'd rate them a 3.5/5.    The people are nice and food is reasonably priced.

A co-worker and I decided to try the Friday buffet which is seafood centric.   We had the arroz con pollo and shredded brisket; they were both full of flavor.  The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.    We did speak with the owner after eating and he shared his background.  He couldn't have been nicer, and did allow us to try a few items off the day's menu (the empandas are not to be missed).   Calypso is a great addition to River Ridge, but helps fill the hole of Latin cuisine in the entire metro area.  I can't wait to get back and try more of the menu!

I've been to this location a few times and while staff are very friendly (i mean really cheerful people!) the looooong wait to be helped can drive a person crazy.

My personal favorites:  The Baudin - a spicy whiskey drink that gives you a soft burn all the way down.   The Gumbo - a delicious dark roux gumbo which perfectly recreated the best chicken and sausage gumbo I have ever had.

The restaurants website did not specify happy hour at the bar neither did Nola eater (other restaurants do specify this as part of their happy hour).  We intended on dining from the menu and not just the happy hour oyster menu which we did so it would have been nice to be extended the oyster happy hour price.  That said we ordered the pig ears which were super crispy and seasoned well, the drum throat which was super flaky and tender but did need a bit more seasoning for my taste, the gumbo which was delicious and the boudin stuffed wild boars heart which was tender and flavorful.  We also ordered from the beer and wine menu and happy with the selections.  Our 10 yr old ordered a great mocktail (tasted like a mojito minus the rum).  Our waiter was very nice and humorous as well as informative as to upcoming beer and wine dinners.  By the way there were only 4 tables at the time (we arrived at 5:45pm) so I would think after my husband asked about the happy hour upon arrival perhaps the manager would have had made a point to notice our check of over $200 and made a point to give us that happy hour special for the oysters.

Rice pilaf is nutty and underseasoned enough to compliment the meat entree.  Love the smoked salmon appetizer!  But stay away from the eggplant!  Very bitter and just...ick!    Dessert is something else...we had a brownie a la mode...the icecream and caramel was delicious..but the brownie was WAY too sweet.    I seriously used to live in this restaurant!

I was no longer confident of the ring's quality after such a runaround (and popped out marcasites), so I asked for a refund: ""We don't do no refunds.""

I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It's a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you're in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don't spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po'boy. I truly feel like it's the best seafood po'boy in town! It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.    Although I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours.

This was the only close place to where we were staying in Gentilly, and he is into the fast food crap. I couldn't understand how eating fast food would help with his sickness but anyway...  The line was to the door of this small Church's.  Loud yapping from large women with several children combined with fried chicken smells filled the air.  When I finally got to the cashier, behind ceiling to floor bullet proof glass, I went to place my order. ""I'll have the number 4 to go."" I was instantly responded to with a sharp ""We outta dat.""  Oh, ""I'll have the number 7 then.""  Once again ""We out.""  I kindly inquired what they did have, only to be given a fiery look. Ultimately Joyanna (real name) was able to make me the number 4, because she suddenly realized they were in fact, not out of the chicken pieces.    I paid, took my receipt and moved down the line back to the abyss of screaming women on cell phones and crying children.  Suddenly an argument broke out between two large black women over whose order should have been done first.   It truly was like a scene out of Madea meets Rasputia.    After 15 minutes had gone by and still no order, I inquired to one of the kitchen staff as to the length of time it would be until my one single order was ready.  Scott, who seemed to be high, told me, ""I dun know.""

Near the end of my trip I was starting to want something other than shrimp and oyster po' boys, catfish, jambalaya, gumbo and red beans.  Starting to.  I still would eat any of those items till the cows came home as long as I am in New Orleans, but I actually began craving meat pies of all things.  This was Louisiana, wasn't it?  Where could I satisfy my craving for a spicy meat pie?  Natchitoches.  But I wasn't going to Natchitoches.  My friend Mandy P. who was born and raised in Natchitoches, LA made me my first ever meat pies.  Similar to empanada in my culture, but had the spice and flavor of Louisiana that I LOVE.  So, it was what I craved and what I wanted.  Believe it or not, it's an item that isn't very easy to find in New Orleans.  There were a remote couple of places in the Quarter that had them on the menu, but I tried them at one place last time I was there and was not impressed, and the other looked like a tourist trap, so I steered clear.  Mandy P. texted me that I must go to Jacques Imos for them as soon as humanly possible, but it was well outside of the Quarter (St. Charles Street Car still isn't back on its full route) and perhaps maybe a little pricey for what I wanted.  I just wanted a simple fix and not a full sit-down meal.  So, John L. and I began our quest, peeking at menus posted outside of restaurants.  (I know, how touristy!)  He vowed, ""Don't worry.  I will find you some meat pies!""  After a handful of places I was starting to think this was a pointless search.  Until John mentioned a little grocery-type deli he passed on a previous stroll that we might try.  Not quite thinking they'd have meat pies (since my other grocery deli love, Verti Marte, doesn't carry stuff like that), we get there and a huge sign outside listed a number of items including ""crawfish pie.""  Wha??  Could they possibly have what I was looking for?  Listed at the top of their menu, forth item down:  MEAT PIE (seasoned cajun beef stuffed pastry deep fried to perfection) $2.50  CHA-CHING!  John came through.  And they were exactly what I wanted (none are like Mandy's, but still soooooo good).  We went back two more times for them towards the end of the trip. By the third time, the workers recognized us and the girl behind the counter merely asked, ""Meat pies?""  I know, sick.  But you can quickly become addicted to these tasty to-go morsels.  French Quarter Deli & Grocery just opened a little over a month ago, but I have a feeling they will do really well with their location, hours and menu.  Their menu is extensive, including appetizers (Mac & Cheese Bites, Crawfish Pistolettes, meat and crawfish pies, etc.), burgers, breakfast sandwiches, chicken wings, po' boys and other deli sandwiches, pastas (Peanut Chicken Pasta, XX Chili Pasta, Linguine with Garlic Butter Sauce and all sorts of add-ons, etc.) fresh salads, and much, much more.  They carry all kinds of beverages, liquors, wines and beers which, yes, they will gladly deliver along with your food order.  They are open and will deliver from the morning until the wee hours (3am on weekdays and 4am on weekends).  I'm so glad this place opened.

First thing Ritz should do is take their name off this restaurant.    Both the service and the food were appalling.    My guest and I arrived at 7:30PM the time of the reservation.  We spoke, momentarily to the host, long enough for him to confirm our reservation and then he picked up a phone call.  He spoke on the phone for about 5 minutes without acknowledging us.  It was long enough for me to find another Ritz employee and explain the situation.  Unfortunately, this employee (a bartender) was not able to help us and went to find another Ritz employee to help us.  By the time the third Ritz employee was involved the Host was off the phone and deigned to show us to our table.  The menu presented to me was soiled (see picture at the following link)  https://plus.google.com/photos/117895691724726875006/albums/5665316290258350801/5838253937848033234?authkey=CLKjte--7pTuWQ  It was disgusting, I have my suspicions as to the source of these unwelcome additions.  The restaurant advertizes themselves as: Ranked as one of the top Farm-to-Table hotel restaurants by Travel + Leisure (January 2011), M bistro's menu is an indigenous approach to the preparation of the finest meats, seafood and produce from farmers throughout the Gulf Region.   I didn't see much evidence of this on the menu, but did select a local salad.  The restaurant was 80% empty but it took quite a while to get our first round of service.    The locally grown salad was completely drenched in dressing.  It was ironic to be in NOLA and have my salad drowned and flooded.  I asked a server to tell the salad chef that the salad was overdressed and her response was ""what?"" I repeated and she said ""OK"".  See a picture of the levy broke salad here:   https://plus.google.com/photos/117895691724726875006/albums/5665316290258350801/5838254027097123522?authkey=CLKjte--7pTuWQ  Next the Chicken.  The presentation was pathetic. One half chicken, split into two parts, and covered with a large quantity of green tasteless fried something (seemed like seaweed) .  The texture of the chicken was profoundly ambiguous, which I found disturbing and unappetizing.    Meantime, my wineglass sat empty so long that I got up and walked back to our host to request a refill.  He also said, ""OK"".  Finally, we were done, and I asked for the check (when wine number 2 was served), and that came pretty quickly.  However, the pickup with the card took so long that it was back to the host for another intervention.    Overall, the most disappointing Ritz experience of my life.",Restaurants

It's just as big as the old bowling alley (they didn't build any walls or anything), and it'll blow you away. This place is definitely for the bar gamer. They have a great selection of drinks and a bomb-ass ladies' room (lounge included). I'm giving Shamrock only 4-stars because it was a little overwhelming for me.

The pizza is pretty good - not the best in the city (slice or PD), but much better than your domino's or the nearby dough bowl (an less saturated with drunk 18 year olds).

The room is bright and welcoming and there are large stones that clear the space of negative energy. Just the smell of the room is healing.   But lets talk about the magic. There are holistic practitioners and healers up there and they will change your life. No matter what you need (acupuncture, holistic healing, energy work, meditation) upstairs at raw has it going on.   I have a lot of issues with anxiety and stress, so along with therapy I decided to try acupuncture. Noell Eans has changed my life. After every session with her I always feel like I have made a breakthrough. She also does energy work which I have also found helpful. While many people reach for a bottle of some sort (pills or other things) to help them cope with their stresses and mental ailments, I have found Noell. I am now a strong believer of meditation not medication.   New Orleans needs a place like Raw and I am so happy that it exists. Go schedule an appointment with one of the amazing healers at Raw. You will not be disappointed.",Restaurants

This family owned and run restaurant is in a gorgeous building right off of the streetcar. The inside has wonderful wooden beams and the decorations were perfect for a taqueria. It felt warm and inviting and you could tell that at one point it was filled with good feelings.  The margaritas and red sangria were okay, but the sangria lacked fruit and the no-salt margarita came with salt. They were definitely not made from a mix- thank goodness.  When we dined here, the entire place was empty except for us...and the family that owned it. There were about ten adults and two children eating around a big table and it was just terribly depressing to see the family who owns the business that is failing eating their meal next to you. Our waitress let us know that her father couldn't keep the place going anymore because of its large size and the economy.   Anyway, on to the food. Our food was good! I had something I've never even heard of before. Wish I could tell you the name- but basically it's a huge slab of cheese fried on the grill with vegetables stuck in it.

We were seated in fact by the General Manager John and his family, and had the pleasure of watching him and his family enjoy multiple waiters and heaping plates of food.  While we waited for service.   After 30 min a waitress approached us and asked us if we had been waited on, we said no, and she said she wasn't sure if we were her table, she left and came back 10 min later and apologized and said she was our waitress.  We ordered drinks and off she went, 10 min later she was back with drinks, Be aware you will pay for water, 2.00 per bottle.  The bloody mary $14.00 was drinkable but nothing special.  We then ordered our entree's I ordered the Crawfish ettouffee and my fiance ordered a bowl of gumbo and the taste of new orleans which was Jambalaya, Etouffee, and redbeans.  Listen I cant stress this enough we grew up on the gulf coast we understand how Gumbo and the other dishes are supposed to taste, if your not from the area you have no idea, so to you it might be good, but let me tell you the food was horrible, the etouffee had no flavor and the gumbo's roux was watery and again had no flavor. The rest of the food was simply not good.  We had purchased a groupon for this place and that included a dessert and so we ordered the bread pudding, again it was horrible, it was tough and rubbery.   That was it, we had had it, so we asked to speak with John the general manager, 20 seconds into our conversation he basically dismissed us and said dont worry ill take care of the meal, while that was generous that wasn't really what we wanted to hear, we continued to try and explain our issues, he then got extremely rude, explained that he was the GM for a multi million dollar operation and if things were that bad, the restaurant wouldn't make it, I disagree, they have a fantastic location on the river in the riverwalk center, and there are plenty of unaware tourist that pay his bills.  He even told me to contact the owner that he would tell me the same thing.  I have yet to do so but im curious as to what his response will be.

The smoked tuna tartar is great but the sweet chips can overwhelm the dish. Definitely get the marinated shrimp and jalapeño jus it is a wonderfully fresh and bright dish.   To close thing up we had the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream, as if that wasn't enough they pour this amazing chocolate sauce on it when it arrives that will have you just dying as you wait to dig in.  Overall Compere Lapin is a great addition to the New Orleans food scene, great for groups or date night with your significant other.",Restaurants

The burger is a bit on the salty side and for some utterly insane reason they don't have mustard and only offer nasty blasphemous ketchup (I HATE ketchup) so the only time I can eat the burger is if I bring my own mustard.  The tachos (tater tot nachos) just don't measure up to the amazing ones at 13 Monaghan so I probably wouldn't get those again.

3367,Restaurant R'evolution,29.9554435,-90.0681471,3.0,"I had a wonderful meal here one evening after my in-laws made reservations for four as a Christmas present.  It's a newer restaurant from John Folse, located in the Royal Sonesta Hotel, not far from Bourbon street.  The ambiance was lovely and inviting, with nice touches from unique light fixtures to a little ""ottoman"" for holding your purse.  The food was well thought out and delicious.  We started with a charcuterie board...it was just meat, no cheese.  There were all sorts of sliced meats, as well as terrine, pate and pickled veggies, with some mustard and other sauces on the side.  The meats were good; it was a nice start.  I then indulged in a half dozen of the oysters on the half shell R'evolution style.  They were so fresh and tasty.  Two of them had a tangerine salsa, another two had lime granita and the others were simply decorated with parsley or something.  They were all very tasty, especially the ones with lime granita.  No cocktail sauce is needed for these.  For my entree, I had the homemade ribbon pasta with crab and leeks.  It was so savory and the perfect meal for someone who doesn't want a heavy dish.  You can really tell a difference in fresh homemade pasta from the dried pasta...it's so delicious.  I ordered the gruyere potatoes au gratin as a side...yum!  Those were some tasty layered, cheesy potatoes.  My husband had the orange molasses duck with turnips and prunes.  It was different, but in a pleasant way.  For dessert, we had the coffee and beignets.  The coffee being, mocha pots de creme.  It was served with black fig jam, which I tried, but decided to ignore.  I liked the beignets simply with the pot de creme.  Service was attentive, when they were around, but it was a slower paced meal in general.  I look forward to (hopefully) getting to eat here for a special occasion next time I'm in New Orleans. :)  Even their bar menu sounds fantastic!",Restaurants

The salad was a good portion size, dressing was not very creamy but it was good! Protein was not included as an option so price options weren't on the menu. I had shrimp, which was very good. We were asked what protein we wanted and I suppose I should have realized it was extra or asked the cost. Didn't find out the cost until we got the check which was a ""fun"" surprise.

1346,The Blue Dog Jazz Club,29.9518600309,-90.0679258331,0.5,"Value: 3 stars Staff: 5 stars Music: 4 stars Atmosphere: 4 stars Drinks & Food: 3 stars   The staff at the hotel are very pleasant and helpful, even when things aren't fully 100% back to normal. You can definitely tell they're short staffed based on wait times, and not having full menu offerings, but overall they seem very happy to accommodate or make alternative suggestions.  They do have valet in the hotel for easy parking. You can wait a little while if they're busy, but they were very careful with all the vehicles and all very nice. It's not the easiest place to park, so I appreciate the valet option.   The band was great though not who I would expect to be playing in that venue I guess; I thought more bebop or contemporary Jazz for this space. Duke's band was playing more swing style, but of course, no one was dancing, so it was a bit odd. There wasn't much of a crowd so they took a rather long break in the middle of the set. I don't blame them, but there was a $10 cover charge so after a while it was annoying.   The staff is top notch, even during these odd pandemic times of shortages. A staff member offered to walk us directly into The Blue Dog, and once inside the bar tender checked our vaccine card and tickets, handed us some menus, told us we could have a seat and she'd be around for our orders soon. She made a few drinks for those that came in before us, and it wasn't long before she was around to take our order. We ordered their cheese plate and pretzel dish along with two drinks. What my guest wanted couldn't be made because they were out of one of the mixers, but the bartender offered something else and he was happy with what she made. I went with wine, and had a good pour for the price. The food was over priced for what was served, so I'd skip that if you go. They couldn't find crackers for our cheese plate for a good 15 minutes, but two staff members stopped by to let us know they were working on it and apologized for the delay - and they eventually brought us crackers. Kudos to the staff again.   I appreciated their extra level of service for something as mundane as crackers, and how nice everyone in the hotel was overall. I'll definitely recommend this place based on service to my tourist friends. For a night at a jazz club though it ended up being a bit pricey with parking, drinks, food, and cover charge. If you're already in the area or staying at the hotel, and you've grabbed food elsewhere, $10 cover per person plus one drink each isn't all too bad.   Small complaint - the doorman had the door open - I know it's a New Orleanian thing so people hear the music and want to pay to come inside - but it was the first night the temps dropped, and no one was really prepared for that door to be open. If it's a cold night, bring a jacket and be prepared to keep it on all night. That was my only real complaint, was them keeping the door open and making it cold.",Nightlife

In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us, let alone do it with any hospitality.   Lousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe, but it was 90% juice, only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here, people, we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us, she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality, and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine, topped with juice! You know, the way they're supposed to be made.  Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.  Food-wise, it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides, so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.

Those who have criticized this museum for being disorganized and expensive are missing a critical point: it's pretty much a grassroots, ""mom and pop"" style Museum. The preservation of Southern culinary history is a pretty cool endeavour, and the CONCEPT of the museum is solid. Displays feature the regional characteristics and culture of various foods and beverages, and the cocktail museum provides a visual timeline of cocktail culture.   The museum, overall, is unique and a visual riot of the tastes, tools, and techniques that bring us Southern cuisine. We began our tour with a stop at the bar in the adjoining restaurant, marveling at an impromptu course in bitters by the very well-versed bartender. The bar itself was brought, in pieces, to the Museum and rebuilt. It was originally built in 1851, I believe.  The tour of the rest of the museum was an eclectic lovefest of the various States of Taste, with exhibits focused on the characteristics of each region's cuisine. The current exhibit was Photography of Modernist Cuisine, which was very striking (the site's ""Exhibits"" page has past exhibits for more info).   Our target, though, was La Galerie d'Absinthe, a private collection not yet fully set up in the museum. Still, we clambered into the back corner to look at the collection and history of Absinthe. That corner morphed into an exhibit featuring ""still life"" of an absinthe house, and the accoutrements of absinthe were fascinating!   The Absinthe exhibit merged with the Museum of the American Cocktail, which was a wall of spirits presented as a timeline of sorts.   Overall, we learned a lot about the evolution of many forms of BBQ and spirits, and definitely intend on returning when we are once again in New Orleans!",Shopping

One can't help but wonder what it would have been like to live in this spectacularly appointed manse.  The family that owned it left most everything intact, so you're looking at a vast amount of authentic rooms and pieces, rather than a warehouse of recreations.

I have used that clipboard every working day since - almost 25 years - and I still love it. I keep thinking that any day it's going to break and I'll need to buy a new one, but so far, so good. I know now that although I couldn't afford it in 1992, the price was, in no way, too high, not for the workmanship and longevity of the item. Some years after 1992, I also bought myself a mini wooden clipboard to use for small items around the house, since now I was a gainfully employed member of society.

They've got a really nice set up, plenty of space for groups. The outdoor patio area is the spotlight of this place, obviously. Sporting a nice size pool and my favorite, the hot tub, there's also a little tiki bar in the pool area as well.   Not sure if they were not expecting the crowd they got that day because service was slooooowwww. Luckily tho, the hot tub along with those nice ladies i was talking to kept me preoccupied so i didn't deal with the bar too much. There were some great specials going on tho, $5 margaritas, $3 tequila shots, but of course one would expect such deals on a day like that.   Most of the crowd tho were being divas and not swimming, which kind of set a weird tone, but it's definitely a spot i'll be stopping into more over the Summer. I'd like to see this place stick around, it could really take off if they promoted more, but New Orleans being the place it is, it's usually not very long before word gets around.",Restaurants

The truffle fries were delicious, and my date's chicken sandwich was also very good.  The coleslaw was a bit mayonnaisey, but the green onion was a very nice touch and complemented the sandwich's flavor well.  My chipotle burger was decent, but I thought it was a notch below some of the other gourmet burgers around town (see, e.g., the Luke Burger).    The Martinis were good, but a little on the pungent side.  After I asked the bartender to make them with a little less vermouth.   What was Bad:  The Cajun Scallop Salad.  There were two important things which were wrong with this dish.   First were the scallops.  I know they were billed as ""blackened and seared,"" but they were more than undercooked.  They were mushy and lukewarm in the middle -- in short, totally raw.    Second was the level of spice for the salad.  I'm no prude when it comes to spice -- I probably put more tabasco on my red beans than most of you.  But this salad was so hot that any of the other flavors of the salad were completely overpowered.  The jicama?  It might as well have not been included.  The honey chipotle pecans?  They might as well have been cardboard.  In light of the $17 price for this dish, you expect more.",Restaurants

Oak fits the bill when way up in the Riverbend.  The space is a departure from the smaller, darker wine bars that populate this city (and that I populate) and it's quite lovely. They somehow maintain this fairy light glow with the lightly-colored walls and furniture illuminated by pretty light fixtures. I'm gonna say it: a more feminine vibe, but that doesn't mean a man couldn't - and shouldn't - feel comfortable here.   And on that note, the crowd isn't primarily female, so there's that (calling all the single ladies). The crowd is very Uptown -grad student rather than the undergrad ubiquity at places like Monkey Hill and St. Joe's Bar (and Delachaise on weekends). Mature and polite young people for the most part and god, do I sound like my Great Aunt Tillie right now. Very different from the all-ages scene at my beloved Patrick's Bar Vin.  Staff is top notch at Oak! Although the place was bordering on very busy when we arrived, we were greeted and seated, but then opted for the circular bar that is awesomely situated in the middle of the room. Both bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive, even asked us if we wanted food. Sadly, I had just consumed enough Japanese food to feed a small village down the block at Chiba, so all I could do was admire the brief menu that promises tasty bites of exquisite things like frites and cheeses and olives. Oh and you small plate haters be rest-assured they have full entrees, too.  Wine list is as you'd expect: lengthy! I've been on a bubbles kick again and they've got 'em. A good selection of reds by the glass but definitely not as extensive as Delachaise & Patrick's. If vino ain't your thing, they have beer and a full bar.   One minor thing: not sure about the acoustics of the room. The band playing was just too loud for the otherwise delightfully hushed setting. A sound person would have rectified the situation (I could be wrong but it seems like the band did their own sound and that is never a good thing. Take it from someone who worked in the biz for years).  I'm looking forward to returning to Oak. I should remark that I came here on a Thursday night and it was the final frigid night of the week, yet it was still comfortably busy. Not sure if it's packed on the weekends, but I wouldn't be surprised, after all this is Oak St, quite the happening Uptown corridor.

3110,Restaurant August,29.95,-90.0668309,3.0,"So on our last night in New Orleans we really wanted an awesome meal.   We had eaten at some of the typical NOLA classics like Galatoire's and Antoine's. But we wanted something a little less ""classic"" and a little more...new? trendy? high-end? I think we wanted something a little more ""New York"". We were at the Hotel Monteleone having afternoon cocktails and asked our waitress her recommendations. She said Restaurant August, without a doubt. I had heard of it and a colleague back home who is from New Orleans had recommended it, but because it wasn't one of the tried and true NOLA classics, I didn't pay much attention.  Obviously I opened my Yelp app and checked it out. Solid reviews, people raving about the food, service, atmosphere. A few photos of the food and interior confirmed that it was, indeed, what we were looking for.   I made a reservation and all they had left was 9PM. No problemo, we are New Yorkers, after all, we are used to eating mad late.   We walked over from our hotel on Bourbon Street to the restaurant. It was in what I suppose you would call the business part of town. Much quieter than Bourbon Street, people dressed nicer, ect.   We walked in and were seated immediately. The space is beautiful. The enormous vintage style crystal chandeliers, wood paneled walls, everything was high end and a lot of thought went into it. It was exactly the sort of more modern and trendy version of what those old New Orleans restaurants looked like inside.   Our server came over immediately to take our drink order. Because I am a complete and total sucker for martinis, I went with that. They were not even close to disappointing. I was swooning over them in minutes.   The menu was awesome, we had such a hard time choosing what to have. The waiter was very helpful with this. He asked us what jumped out at us and then went through the composition, cooking method and ingredients in each dish and why he thought they were special. It was incredible to hear about the preparation, each dish had a special twist to it, making it far and away different than that same dish at another restaurant.   We decided to share appetizers. First, we ordered the Foie Gras prepared three ways. Three small portions of foie gras (which is one of my favorite things) all cold or slightly warmed, each composing their own little dish, completely different from each other, yet tying together nicely. We also had the handmade potato gnocchi, tossed with blue crab and black truffle. It was some of the most perfect gnocchi I have ever had. Substantial, but still light and fluffy. The sauce mixed with the crab and truffles...divine.   Another round of martinis later, and I was all jazzed up for our entrees.   But first! An amuse bouche. A half quail egg shell stuffed with a Parmesan mousse and topped with an avocado custard...sounds weird, it was amazing and decadent.   For my main, I ordered the Chappapeela Farms Duckling, with silver queen corn, buttered radish and blackened foie gras. It was SO GOOD. I have recently discovered that I enjoy duck and August did it right. slightly crispy skin, tender meat, the sauces perfectly complimenting the duck, and enough foie gras to have some with each bite of duck. Really, an incredible dish.   When they offered us dessert, I was a little hesitant because I was so, so full already. But once again, our waiter went through how each dessert is composed and what ingredients are used, so once again we were pumped and all ordered a dish.   I had the Banana Pudding and OHMYGODDDDDD. You best book your tickets to NOLA for this dish alone. It came with peanut butter, marshmallow and nila wafer ice cream. I was legit licking my plate clean at the end. Everyone at the table said it was amazing.   I want more! Help!  All throughout the meal the waiter was attentive and friendly, informative and we never wanted for anything. I was sad to go at the end, but so pleased we took the chance on something in the business district.

If you like octopus, this may become your absolute favorite octopus dish in the city...or anywhere. The murder point oysters with Meyer lemon granita are light, delicious, and salty fresh from the sea.  The goat cheese agnolotti is served with homemade potato chips on top; the contrast in texture and saltiness of the chip/sweetness of the cheese, is sublime. The grilled lobster curry is as good as it sounds, and the portion is very generous. The wagyu carpaccio - is healthy and super delicious.  The final appetizer we tried was an Asian fried veal rib with scallion egg fried rice - fantastic and not to be missed.  As for entrees, there are three fish dishes: halibut, snapper and flounder. You really can't go wrong with any of these dishes. All three are outstanding. There are also pierogis, which are so good a carnivore won't miss the meat, and a really beautiful and contemporary version of beef bourguignon.  Someone at our table had chicken and loved it - I would not ever order chicken while eating out so I did not waste any room in my stomach on that dish.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate pot du creme, which had cocoa nibs, sea salt and whipped cream - this is rich and wonderful if you are a chocolate lover. The apple-cranberry crisp with bourbon ice cream was my husband's favorite, and it is a winner. . The decor is modern, warm and inviting, an enormous transformation from those who remember Rue 127 (I liked Rue 127, you just will not recognize the place). The front of house and wait staff are friendly, and make you feel like you are a special guest. We can't wait to return again and again!",Restaurants
2778,BarCulture,29.9687045,-90.105147,4.0,"This was probably the worst bar service I have ever experienced . I went there on the Tuesday night after Christmas and I was completely appalled at the bartenders . First of all , there was only two which was ok for their bar size and the selection of the alcohol ... So here's my problem , I went to the bar 2 different times in 2 different sections of the bar and was completely ignored by the bartenders . (Lady with the dreads specifically.) She looked me in my eyes multiple times and skipped on to the next person without even taking my order which was ridiculous . I would think as a bartender you would be more attentive to the people coming to your bar ! To make matters worse , there was a guy behind me trying to get service as well and he didn't get any . He made a comment to me saying "" If this isn't the worst service , idk what is ""! She would rather help what looked like her ""regulars""  rather than us new people to their establishment . The other bartender was smoking hookah and drinking her own drink behind the bar !!! There's Nothing wrong with enjoying the job but atleast do the job first !!!! The Horrible experience and I will never be back . I don't like unsatisfactory customer service , and that's exactly what I got !",Nightlife

1048,SukhoThai,29.9208414,-90.1032659,3.0,"So I finally had a chance to check out the new Sukho Thai.  I am  definitely a critic's critic and the type of person which likes to find places that  aren't heavily advertised. I personally believe the food and service of a restaurant  should be  allowed to speak for its self and I must admit a good  happy hour is definitely a bonus.     I was kind of nervous due to the mixed reviews but I had yet to find a thai restaurant which has blown me away and yes I have gone to La Thai,  so i figured I should try and see what this restaurant truly had.  So I went where any curious customer would go and I requested to be sat in the  bar area  and I must say I was not dissappointed.  Their bar area featured the typical stools but also had  an additional  table area  if I preferred. Complete with  a wide selection of import beers and a wine list which showed true care in its creation(I hate seeing kendal jackson on a wine menu or any grocery store brand, lol).   Well back to the experience...I  must give kuddos to the bartender for truly guiding me,  recommendations are one thing but he even had knowledge of specialty items that were not on the menu and unique personal takes on thai staple menu items,(e.g. ""glass noodles in the pad thai for a lighter filling feeling and add pineapple to it if you truly trust me""  plus he  brought  out an amuse bouche).  That is impressive in my eyes and made me feel as if I was the only person that mattered.  Three letters sum up this experience W-O-W.      Anyways,  you are probably wondering about the food and what i ordered.  Well I took this bartenders advice(otherwise why ask,  lol) and ordered these recommendations and I must say he was correct.  So here it goes.... the complimentary amuse bouche was a total shock,  the orange shrimp appetizer was both light and refreshing but wasn't on the menu(so thank you again for guiding me), and  pad thai with glass noodles and pineapple must receive two thumbs up due to creativity and flavor). I am not quite sure why people are saying this place is overpriced or that the food service is below par.  In regards to price it is  definitely on par with the other thai restaurants,  maybe its just the LA style decor which intimidates  them  but i personally loved the decor.  Anyways I hope this review helps somebody.  All i can say about this place in closing is I personally only write on yelp if i have a disappointing experience or an above expectations one and yelpers this one was definitely above my expectations.",Restaurants

And speaking of music, the live music bands that you encounter at every block of your city.... how can you not love dancing through this amazing city???? And don't forget those dollar bills for tipping-- the street artists and musicians are fabulous!!!!  The talent abounds within the streets of this cobble stone city. It's an epicurean paradise--- full of seafood and creole, and cajun cooking. I mean, before we met, I had no idea that you could make so many dishes with crawfish!!!!!!  Pack your Rolaids, my friends. Oh, NoLa.... there's a festival happening almost every week in this town. The party never stops with you, and like the tshirt says---Soul truly is Waterproof. Until we meet again,  New Orleans..... you'll be in my heart!!!!",Shopping

1907,United Hardware,29.9650247237,-90.0564314898,19.0,"This place is pretty good.  They usually have what I need.  Today, out of the three keys I had copied, 2 of them worked.  The third was a copy to a padlock, so I was kind of expecting it not to work anyway.  Whatever, this place is convenient, so that's cool.  I can't give this place a higher rating yet because I usually don't want to go in there because there's a tall guy who is either the manager or the owner who seems like a real prick.  I have seen him straight-up yell at employees.  There's never a reason for one adult to yell at another in a work environment, unless:  1) You work with your lover and you just caught him/her fucking someone else.  At work. 2) You work with heavy machinery or in construction and you need to yell warnings at each other when something is about to crush someone. 3) You are a garbage man and you have to yell at each other for whatever reason it is that garbage men yell at each other when they ride down my street picking up garbage at 4am.  They never sound angry, though.  They actually sound quite jovial.  It's always a nice thing to wake up to, because then I can look at the clock and be like, ""Damn, I get to sleep for 2 more hours.  My life is fucking awesome."" 4) Someone you work with is hard-of-hearing and you need to yell in order to be heard.  None of these were the case.  This guy was just a jerk, and it made everyone in the store really uncomfortable.  So anyway, until I know that that guy is not working there anymore, I can only give this place 3 stars, because I dread going in there.  You are a grown-ass man yelling at another grown-ass man because he is sweeping when you want him to do something else.  Get a grip, you look like a spoiled brat.",Shopping

The host recommended we have the Sunny Day drink, a delicious fresh mimosa style drink that was very reminiscent of a spiked orange julius. Then we had soy mochas, some of the better coffe we had on our whole trip, it was really good.    We ordered the Huevos Rancheros with no ham, and BELT Croissant sandwich without the bacon, both were really fresh and yummy!   Highly recommend this place for fresh juice, coffee, and breakfast.

I've been to enough of these workshops that the daily continental breakfasts and lunches can kind of blend together. In this case, the first day breakfast (so so sweet rolls) and lunch (basic sandwiches) were unremarkable.  Yet Day 2 featured some really good breakfast burritos and mid-day paninis, which were a considerable improvement. Day 3 breakfast featured tasty bacon and eggs, which I only nibbled due to a previous 6 AM walk over to Cafe du Monde for coffee and beignets.   Overall, my Expresso Express experience was better than ""A OK"" and a little less than ""I'm a Fan"", which in online review speak is 3.5 Stars.

Personnel are very freindly but lack the knowledge of the product. Only time I had them really speak to me with much knowledge of any product was their GNC club discounts (you have to pay for).   Which I did.  The products are pretty much broken up by brand in here which you would think would make it easier to find what you are looking for.  Not really.  Took me a while to find a few items I was looking for.    And like all GNCs they are expensive.  But they do sell very quality product.  As much as I complain I still belive I'll be going back to them. The customer service was actually decent and with the club discounts it actually helps if you are always replenishing.

If you don't fit into standard vintage sizes, these dresses are the closest you'll get to authentic 1930's pieces without a time machine. As an added bonus, they carry a great selection of makeup, shoes and vintage lingerie!  They'll also do in-house alterations to make sure your dress fits perfectly, which is great if you're extra curvy or have less standard proportions. Their dresses are also washable, which makes them much easier to deal with than many other vintage reproduction lines.

3186,Black Label Icehouse,29.9321526,-90.0900611,4.0,"Those wicked pickles, that smoky brisket and bacon wrapped jalapeños stuffed with cream cheese you say? Count. Me. In.  Black Label BBQ fed a few of our Yelpers at our end of the year bash and ran out of food tout de suite. So fast, in fact, that although I arrived fairly early, it was already devoured by the time I made it to the table.  Well, of course I had to see what the fuss was about. We headed there less than a week later.  BLBBQ is located inside of Barrel Proof. It's a pop up but it's not that easy to find once you're in there. We had to look around a bit before we noticed it and it's really dim in there so that makes it challenge. Walk in and head straight back and slightly over to your left you'll notice the hostess stand where you go right up and order. It's opposite the bar, if that helps. Place your order and cross over to the bar for a beer (Bloody Mary) and have a seat at one of the many tables. The hostess will then bring out your death by BBQ.   I really liked the brisket...the flavor was incredible, but it was a little dry. The poppers were wonderful and my friend stole all but one because they were that good. Those pickles? Sweet Baby Jesus. They were so good. I am not above stalking the chef for that recipe. Ain't no shame in the wicked pickle game.",Restaurants

A plus in my book. We started with the tomato basil and crab and corn soups. The crab and corn was not thick with a roux it was seasoned perfectly with hunks of crab meat. The tomato basil was also delicious and seasoned well. I had the bbq shrimp. They were large easy to peel shrimp in a flavorful sauce that was a tad different than most bbq. The sauce seems like it had a cream base. I liked it but it wasn't what I expected. The crab cakes were AMAZING. Delicious and again full of crab meat and seasoned perfectly. The size so large definitely good for sharing. The garden salad was also fresh and lettuce crisp.

I think this is a newer place, opened up within the last month on Decatur Street.  During happy hour select appetizers and drinks are half price, which is a great deal.  I had the Legitimate Business Man cocktail (made with Old Forester 1897 whiskey!) and as far as I know unique to this establishment.  It was strong and smooth, and a steal at only $6.  They have other drinks too which are equally well valued.    I also had the Turtle soup, which I've always wanted to try.  It's a New Orleans staple, and served at quite a few places around town. At $6, it was a great time to try.  They even mix sherry in front of you, which is a nice touch.  It was excellent and would order again.    Really great place and seems more casual than most Brennan places, but that might be because I was there for Happy Hour and sat at the bar.  Also being on Decatur has more of a festive attitude.

It's about the only mechanic shop I trust. They do great work at a reasonable/fair price.  WHAT WORKED? This was my first visit to Liberty's. As many times as I've been to the Whole Foods next door or the mechanic, I had never set foot in the place. I had wanted to support their work like Cafe Reconcile and Cafe Hope and other organizations.   So I ordered the Liberty's Breakfast, which consisted of two eggs my way (I'm partial to scrambled), two slices of bacon, toast and my choice of grits (cheesy or sans cheese), potato hash or fruit. I chose the cheesy grits. Everything was delicious. The eggs were fluffy and seasoned, the grits were hot and, well, cheesy. The cheese was thoroughly incorporated into the grits, not just shredded cheese thrown on top. I really appreciated that. The grits were creamy and only needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper. The bacon had a really good flavor and was crispy and chewy. The toast, however, took me by surprise. I normally write toast off, but this toast was really good. It was chewy with a nice bite and had a good flavor. It paired well with the butter and grape and strawberry jelly. I don't know what kind of bread it was, but there were little pieces of oat flakes on the crust.  I ordered an Arnold Palmer, but it's execution didn't meet expectations. It wasn't bad by any means, just different. They used black tea, but I'm probably used to some plain, run of the mill tea in my Arnold Palmers.  The place is really cute and looks like it would be a cool place to hangout, something akin to Starbucks or most other cafes. It has ample seating inside with an accompanying patio.   The service was great. My server Shantrell (""Trell"") appeared to be a little annoyed when I first arrived, but she soon warmed up to me and was professional and sweet in the end. She was knowledgeable about the menu. They accept Apple Pay, which is always a plus, but the feature wasn't working that day.   I saw an offer for a free pastry if I checked in and I took advantage of that, of course. Like, yeah!! The pastries that day consisted of a really big blueberry muffin, croissant, lemon ginger bread, zucchini bread and perhaps a couple other items. It was a nice selection. The zucchini bread, which I'm told is gluten free, not that it matters because I can consume gluten and non-gluten and everything else just fine, had the texture of banana bread. It was ok, but there was some grittiness when I swallowed. Not sure what that was all about.   I decided to make a pit stop before I left and noticed the bathroom was pretty clean. Always a good sign. I also noted that while it was quiet around 10:00, it was quite bustling by the time I left.   WHAT DIDN'T WORK? I'll definitely be back.",Restaurants

I showed up at 10:30pm and the front door was locked because they lock it between the hours of 11pm-6am...I rang the doorbell and went to the front desk where I wasn't greeted. I then introduced myself and said I had a reservation, started the check in process then the girl at the front desk took a phone call, then another phone call....11:10 I check in and head to my room, which was smaller than described the floors dirty and a little dusty, not too bad but it doesn't look like they clean as well as other hotels. I take a shower in the morning and yes the rain shower head though looks fancy isn't the greatest when the shower doesn't close so water does get everywhere. I have a street view which is really loud but didn't effect my sleep, but I'm not a light sleeper. My biggest issue was when I was randomly walking through the Nola streets having a good time and decided to check where a free atm was and looked at my account and saw that they charged me again for a room that I prepaid for, I went back to the hotel asked them to fix it and also just randomly checked hotel prices and exact same room for more than half the price. So let me get you the quick details: 1. I was not greeted when I entered and took 30+ mins to check in.  2. The room wasn't as big as described(they explained to another resident that is European style so it is the same size just looks smaller...) 3. They double charged me (when i first made the reservation i thought I would actually be charged then, but i wasn't and just randomly without warning they did 2 separate transactions so if you're not prepared for that i don't know what to tell you!) 4. They won't prove match their own rates after you check in. If i wouldn't have checked they would have prove matched my last day because you need 72hrs to do it, so for a Sunday I'm paying $348 bit if you checked in right now you'd pay 135... I have this place a two when I started writing based off ambiance because even though it's small, the exposed brick and crappy hardwood floors do lol nice...that's it, customer service isn't the greatest, fare practices are out the window and street noise is loud. But if you want to stay here after all that, well I warned you. I checked in Thursday night at 11:10pm it's 4:05pm Friday and I'm writing this review...Oh housekeeping starts around 9am so be prepared for the knocks on the door but they're cool!  My honest recommendation if you want to stay here: don't book too early, they have good rates when you get closer to your date but also certain days might be booked already, so it's hard to accomplish if you're a planner.",Restaurants

They tried to move our 9 pm reservations up to 5 pm on the day of. Which was not possible. Then they finally agreed to a 7:30 pm time. We had made these reservations weeks before and had planned our travel arrangements around it. Not the best start. We rushed to get ready and get there.   The menu was limited. I had the redfish bon ton which was rather bland even with what looked like a nice crust of seasoning. Another person at the table had the oysters alvin and said she felt like she could get the same thing for much less and with more flavor anywhere else. I tried the gumbo for an appetizer, again rather bland and lots of crab/shrimp shells. By dessert there were 3 options: bread pudding, butter pecan ice cream, or bread pudding with the butter pecan ice cream. Most of our party opted for the third option and all we could say was that it was good but that the whiskey was really overpowering. Taking a bite was like taking a shot. We enjoyed mediocre coffee and left with a nearly $700 check for 6 people with $80 a plate and 2 bottles of wine--we figured that wasn't too bad. But we did feel that we overpaid for rather bland food and a just ok atmosphere. We were rather packed in and it was hard to get out from the table and to the restroom. Lots of climbing and squeezing between chairs.   The reviews that say go to mothers down the street are right. We did that on the last day of our trip and were not disappointed.

My eating schedule was already jammed packed but I somehow made a little room for this spot. How could I not? It's like being in Seattle Washington and not trying out the original Starbucks despite being mere steps away.  Unlike the original Starbucks that started it all though which kept it's original historic decor and logo, this place have disappointingly modernized the interior and would not look out of place at any other location in the US. There is no sense of history in it.  Despite that, I read through multiple reviews that Popeye's taste different and even better than what is to be found elsewhere in the US because of the difference in spice that they use.  This I found to be true although for me it wasn't as big a difference as I had assumed.  Seems more tender and moist than my last few experience with the chain too. Would I go out of my way to eat here if I knew and was further away? Nope. Lucky I didn't have to. I would rate the flavor only slightly above what I would rate a regular Popeyes. A 3.5 instead of 3   The ordering system at this location is bizarre. They have two separate lines for taking the order at the back. Then you go on another line further down to pay at a register. Then if you want condiments or take it out, you have to take it to the center of the restaurant much further away so they could do those things for you.  And I have never used ghetto on a review thus far so this would be my first. Some of the people, including the management acts kind of ghetto. Just being on line  once I have already seen the person taking the order being rude and disrespecting the person in front of me. Then I saw said person be sent to the back because she was being rude to both the customer and the manager. Then when the manager took over the ordering when I was next, she made this comment when I ordered a spicy chicken instead of the regular one. ""Well, we are closed so we don't have any more spicey chickens."" Then stared at me. I was ok not having spicey since I did get there near closing time but it was strange to have attitude thrown my way for innocently ordering something I didn't know they ran out of.  While eating, I had also seen the workers gathering and just joking with each other about some of the events that just happen, not caring who is within earshot.   I took no point out for that but I assume some of the people coming here might want to be forewarned of this just in case.  Now I could scratch off going to the original Popeyes off my bucket list.

2094,Orchid Seafood,29.9752983,-90.0792518,17.0,"New Orleans is one of the few cities where excellent cuisine comes from sketchy, health code questionable, corner stores. Orchid Seafood is no exception.   The entire place is about the size of a typical neighborhood store. There are no tables and chairs; it is a to-go style place. Also, don't kid yourself. The corner store designation is a bit generous, as their stock of dry goods is seriously lacking (mainly just cold drinks and candy...don't come here trying to make groceries). But you come to Orchid for the hot food.   The food is always hot and fresh, well seasoned, and the shrimp and fish are a generous size.  The service is quick and the women behind the counter are polite. The prices run anywhere from $6 - $15 depending on what you're ordering and some items are a little steep for a corner store but well worth it ($8 for the pasta...sheesh). If you're ordering something that hasn't been freshly made, they will politely ask you to wait....and I will always wait for hot shrimp, fresh out the grease.  My deduction of one star is mainly because the credit card minimum (aren't those illegal anyway?) and the food is inconsistent. The shrimp pasta is great, but if you get a scoop that's more cheese than shrimp, suddenly you're eating a salty sort of mac and cheese. Overall, excellent corner store fare, which natives know is the true fine dining of New Orleans.",Restaurants

I have been here three times; once with friends the day after Isaac visited NOLA, once alone 4 days after the hurricane, and once for take away.   Reasons to go: 1) Good food.  The value of the quality is amazing.  This pro alone is worth overcoming the top two negatives below. 2) Unique chili dogs; sliced franks in half on flame-toasted buns... 3) Wi-Fi.  Haven't used it but they offer it.  At least that's what the posterboard with sharpie sign displays on the counter. 4) Efficiency & versatility behind the counter.  The people behind the counter can do multiple jobs well.  I was impressed. 5) This place might be a high 2 star or a low 3 except that they were open and functioning well post-hurricane when everyone else was closed.  Outstanding!  Reasons to avoid: 1) Ca$h only! ATM is on sight.  This sucks because I never carry cash...ever.  So it's an extra $2.50 (im guessing at the ATM fee here) to pull out $20 and pay for a $9 dollar meal.  This is the definition of 'hassle' 2) Small town feel.  From the 80's wood paneling that echoes single-wides of yesteryear to the attitude of the staff ringing ""Didja bring that rain with ya?"", this place exudes small town.  This is a big negative for me.  Small town hates outsiders but tolerate you when you have a descent attitude and pay without asking stupid questions about the menu items, or when they plan on accepting credit cards or if they have a gold member's club that allows free fricken refills.    3) No stinking drink refills.  If you want to piss this guy off, have him pay $2 for a stinking fountain drink and not allow refills.

The portion size of the overall sandwich is fair but if you would like a little extra of something, you'll for sure need to ask for it.   The cheese fries were solid; the cheese sauce had a hint a jalapeño flavor so the cheese wasn't too bland. The fries were slightly undercooked though.

The place was bustling and very busy. We were sat about 15 minutes later at a cozy booth. The service and food were phenomenal. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because my boyfriend's steak came out incredibly overdone (he ordered it medium- pink all the way through and it came out well, without a touch of pink). I understand that things happen, food gets messed up, but this is a steakhouse and a $40 steak. My boyfriend did not complain, I'm sure the steak would have been fixed and replaced, but we did not want to wait for another one to be prepared. My steak (the petite filet with blue cheese) was cooked impeccably at medium rare. Our sides- the au gratin potatoes and asparagus were amazing as well as our dessert (triple chocolate cake). All in all, the experience, service, and food was worth the money. Oh!

Alas, not open at 1:30 in the afternoon. That gave me time to Yelp it and learn that the day you really want to eat here is Thursday when they make the seafood baked potatoes.  Everybody else wanted Italian on Thursday, so I decided to get a couple of those potatoes to go for later. 6:00 I go in there and the joint is hoppin'!  R&B music we could hear 2 doors down, folks spilling out onto the corner to smoke and drink. It's a true, blessed hole in the wall-concrete floor, dark walls, ceiling painted black except for the pieces of particle board stuck up there for some reason. You order your food at the window in the back and have a seat while a server bags up orders, hunts you down and collects your money; I don't know how she kept everybody straight, but she did.  A potato with seafood and crab meat is $12 with tax, and one would make a light meal or big side for two people. The potatoes are cooked just right, covered with shrimp and crabmeat in an étouffée-like sauce with a delayed afterburn that's not overwhelming. I loved it!

Steve is a ""real"" S. La. guy - from Oakdale, La. where he still generously performs with his bands for friends, family and other locals pretty often.  Steve has always been a gifted guitarist, and it isn't hard to find him booked to play these days (look for Hollyrock or The Ice Man Special - both are playing in Oakdale on Thanksgiving eve, 2016).  Steve's shop, International Vintage Guitars, has inventoried many rare, hard to find, and highly desirable guitars (and amplifiers, effects, etc.) for decades.  He must be some kind of wizard to find them, but he keeps digging up incredible guitars (check his FB page where he occasionally posts new and exciting instruments: https://www.facebook.com/stephen.staples.505).  Steve is a virtual walking encyclopedia of knowledge on guitars, equipment and the music of our generation (and a couple of prior generations), and it is always fun to hear what gem will share next.  IVG's customer list is a virtual who's who of guitar greats from around the world, and regular folks can get the same great service at IVG (and not all of the guitars for sale have incomprehensible price tags).  I love New Orleans and all of its music, food, and culture, but even if I didn't it would be worth the trip just to go to International Vintage Guitars and visit with Steve Staples.

We missed out on the fresh desserts, though they looked excellent.   My friend was impressed with the small, but varied wine selection.

I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home.

A transfer station for RTA, the bus system for New Orleans, is nearby and I have been hit up for money, random things. It can be unpleasant. I have also seen fist fights inside, which probably explains why they have a uniformed police officer in the evenings inside. The clerks can be a bit short tempered, but the one time I saw an actual fist fight, they were perfectly calm and kept checking people out as if nothing was happening at all. They have your usual trappings. This location does not have propane tanks like other locations in the area. Hank Hill would be disappointed. They also do not have a red-box for your movie needs.

The lovely clerk gave us that price, but we felt vaguely guilty. Then, the bartender was extremely overwhelmed despite the fact that the restaurant was not at all full. There was one large party that appeared to be a wedding or bachelorette celebration, and the drinks for that had her terribly backed up. Consequently, service was terrible. After we'd gotten drinks and wandered the (wonderful!) museum, we tried to go back to the bar to order some food and another drink. The bar was full and there was no host station or any server to direct us to a table. No one made eye contact, and unwilling to do the work ourselves, we settled our tab and left.

The 7oz. was way big. You can get the usual hipster burger add-ons like a fried egg, mushrooms, or super thick bacon smoked with whatever free range wood of the week people are smoking bacon with. Overall the best burger I've had after trying all of the new trendy burger joints around town. Good job.  I have to agree with some of the other posters here. The place is very small. If you like to hear 18 year old waitresses talk about bubblegum and Miley Cyrus' latest ass tattoo, then this is your place. Although, they were super duper nice and friendly. The dishwasher kid was sitting at a customer table as was the manager. Everything was a little too cozy for my taste. I had a place twice that size and it was a 2 man operation. You don't need waitresses when you can hand the cashier your wallet from the front door.   Pricing was a little off on the high side. When everyone knows you buy your cans of Coke from Sam's for about .23¢ a can, charging $1.75 is a bit cheeky. Cheeky monkeys aside, I spent $33 plus tip for 2 burgers, an order of chili cheese fries and 2 cokes. I'll let you decide.

To begin this is not a review on the restaurant end, I've always enjoyed the brunch and have always left satisfied with what I've ordered and the service has always been great. This concerns more with the bar side and the outrageous $20 cover to enter the pool only to leave minutes later because the amount of people was the equivalent to all the people you see in a wave pool at a water park and god knows what's going on beneath the surface.   I have never seen such a lack of urgency with the bartenders both in the front and in the pool area as was displayed today. I understand what it means to be in the weeds but when your staff is dragging or in their case dancing and having casual conversations with other patrons while there are other people waiting to be served and showing no recognition of how long one individual has been waiting there to order vs. someone who just walked up is frustrating as a customer who was just looking to relax. Staffing wasn't the issue, there was more than enough bartenders to handle the crowds both in front and in the back bar. The issue was bartenders who showed zero lack of customer awareness and were rude to customers when voicing their displeasure at the amount if time they've had to wait.

The cold brew wasn't to my personal preference; however, maybe it's an opportunity for them to connect with Mojo down the street!  The first 90 minutes are complementary if you're coming in to co-op and there are plenty of outlets throughout The Business Bar. After that your food & beverage spend is applied to the duration of your stay so if you munch and imbibe throughout your stay it all balances out.

As a consumer, if I had one suggestion it would be this- the menu is really big; there's breakfast, sandwiches, poke, sushi, salads, a ton of sides and spam. I would pare it down a bit and maybe stick to sushi, poke and spam- I don't think you need to offer a ton of sandwiches, salads and sides.

I was in love, but thought I would never be able to own such a beautiful and expensive piece of jewelry, plus I had no idea that I would soon be receiving a proposal. My man was paying close attention to my reaction of that ring. When he proposed later that evening he told me that he wanted it to be mine. When we went back to Naghi's, Biggie was great about bartering on the price and accepting a down-payment to hold the ring for a month.

And the mussels were overcooked.  The grilled calamari tasted like rubber. I was really not expecting what came out. I have never seen calamari that looked like a big round cut up pancake. I was expecting small tendrils. I am not a calamari expert though.   The last thing we had was the lamb stew, which I have heard is really good. It tasted good, if not a little too salty. But it was not a stew, but more of a bowl full of chunks of slow cooked lamb with a carrot here and there.   I have been looking forward to trying this place for a while, but it was a disappointment. I will not be going back. It did have a great atmosphere though. Quite loud, but cozy.",Restaurants

(Rimshot sound)  The store is somewhat small and they have ok prices on some things, but as mentioned, the wait time ain't fun.  They had a dude working the cash register and a ""Little Miss Thang"" employee was re-stocking groceries.  I asked her if someone else could help with the long line of customers and she responded, ""Mmmhmm"" and went off to get someone else.  A number of minutes later an employee came out and half-heartedly starting ringing people up.  The wait time wouldn't be bad if you came into the store stoned out of your mind (not promoting that) and wanted to stare at the ceiling/walls/groceries while you waited in the long line.  Ok, maybe I bit of hyperbole, but the couple times I have been in there, there wasn't much or a rush to ring customers up.  Also, when a lady did a return on some products, two employees appeared out of the office (probably on ""break time"") and helped the cashier help the lady...which answers the more pertinent question...Why weren't they out there originally helping people get rung up?  Oh well, I give up.",Shopping

Fish & Chips . . . and I gotta tell ya, that was the best catfish I've had in a long time! Not at all muddy tasting, and with a nice light breading.

This cost me $115, which does not even include the $10 additional charge for each spray tan cartridge. Mind you I worked at a tanning salon for 4 years and NEVER paid for tanning, so this was a lot of money for me to spend!!!   After I confirmed that there was no expiration date and compared prices around town, I decided to go with the deal. Without this promotion I would have NEVER paid 115 for just 4 tans.  After using 4 spray tans over the course of the next couple of months, I entered the salon for my next spray and was informed that I NO LONGER HAD ANYMORE TANS!!!!  Apparently, when I bought my package of 8 spray tans, they actually only gave me 4!????!!!  The man working was not apologetic, nor did he attempt to accurately research or respond to my concern, that I had paid for 8 and that there should be 4 more left.    I was very calm and asked for the owner to call me, which she never did. It has now been two weeks and the situation has yet to be resolved. I returned to the salon today, only for the same guy to tell me, ""its not my fault the owner hasn't called you"" and act very rude to me!!!   I was shaking when I left there!!!!!   THIS IS FRAUD!!!!

It was during Mardi Gras and we had a peacock theme. The wedding was held at Broussard's restaurant in their courtyard which is already a beautiful space in and of itself. But what Shane did to the courtyard was simply like a fairytale. The conditions and constraints he had to work in due to the Mardi Gras festival and all the road closures and whatnots did not make this an easy event for him. He rolled with it all flawlessly.  In our initial consult many months ago back in April, we outlined a vision. We asked for blues and greens, whimsy and romance but in a way that did not detract from an already beautiful outdoor setting. What he gave us was blues and greens, feathers and bling tastefully placed everywhere with lots and lots of candles and romantic touches. He nailed our vision and delivered in spades.   I will say that we had a lot of unique touches and requests to include with our wedding and shipped several boxes of things down for Shane to place and include in our overall design. He nailed them perfectly and when I walked in and saw everything from our time capsule to our crazy hand made arts and crafts guest book table all so perfectly displayed I breathed a sigh of relief. It's a little nerve wracking to have a destination wedding (we are from the West Coast) and wonder will the end product really reflect my vision... It did!   And then I will say about the lighting... About two weeks before my photographer realized there wouldn't be enough lighting to provide for good photos. I contacted Shane in a panic and he handled the last minute freak out with skill and calmness. I know this may make me seem either neurotic or a bridezilla, which I'm neither... But I digress...

Okay, so the first time I went was on a Saturday night. There was a bit of a wait, but after about 10 minutes we were seated on the front patio. It was a nice evening, so I was happy to sit outside. My only complaint, and it had NOTHING to do with Del Fuego, was that we were seated next to a large party of college guys who were loud and reacted with ""OH!!!!"" every time one of them said something. I could have done without that.  So, I ordered a house margarita and looked over the menu. The margarita came on the rocks and tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. For the appetizer, we decided on the Queso Fundido con Chorizo Verde which is melted queso with meat and spinach served with small soft tortillas so that you can make little wraps. It was delicious and full of flavor with a nice mix of spices. For my entree, I decided on the Los Tres Hermanos Burrito (The Brothers Three) which came packed with pork, chicken, rice beans, guacamole and onions. The burrito was perfect and it was so good and a great deal at $9. We also had the chance to sample some tequilas, and while I am not a ""drink tequila straight"" type of person, I found it smooth with little to no ""after burn"".  When I went back, on a Tuesday, there was no wait at all and we were seated inside, which I think I prefer to sitting outside. We got the Ceviche which is gulf fish with tomatoes, jalapenos, lime, cilantro and tomatillos. It comes with hard chips for dipping. It was so good and so fresh. I honestly probably could have just eaten that and left happy. I liked the Tres Hermanos burrito so much the first time, that I got it on my second visit as well.

3123,Miss River Restaurant,29.9490882913,-90.0638995172,15.0,"Truly an amazing and exquisite dining experience! Chef Elon Shaya and the entire Miss River team have created a flavorful New Orleans menu and thoughtful craft cocktails.   We started with the New Orleans Rum punch, which was equally balanced in flavor, sweetness, and strength. As a result, we each enjoyed two of these cocktails!  Our meal included: Crab au gratin, Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken with sauces, red beans and rice, and baked sweet potato.   The crab au gratin was my least favorite item. It was good, but quite an expensive appetizer. While the crab meat itself was sweet, succulent, and fresh, the serving size (approximately 6 ounces) for $18 was a bit rich. Also, the au gratin topping was appropriately toasted but the entire dish lacked flavor/seasoning and a binding component (i.e., creaminess).  The Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is a show-stopper! The crust is crunchy and flavorful, the meat is tender, and the overall presentation is magnificent! The staff initially serves the chicken whole, for purposes of presentation. Immediately thereafter, it is whisked away to the carving station. By the time the pieces of chicken return, resting deliciously on a bed of rosemary, the accompanying sauces are there at the table waiting. There are three sauces, which are seasoned honey, crunchy red pepper, and a green herbs. Each of the sauces provided their own flavor, from sweet to spicy to pungent. Truly, the chicken was so perfectly seasoned that the sauces were not required, but they did add to the overall chicken experience.  The whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is an a la carte item, so we chose red beans and rice and baked sweet potato as accompaniments. The baked sweet potato was classic and delicious. The red beans and rice dish was well-seasoned and spicy. The red beans may be too spicy for non-Orleanians but a nice complement to the chicken. Plus, the rice was cooked perfectly!  The sweet end to the meal was lagniappe from the staff! While my specific recollection may be slightly amiss, the two different treats were chocolate chicory cookies and banana pralines. Both were flavorful and a perfect finalé.",Restaurants

3448,Pure Barre - New Orleans,29.9203875,-90.1053679,17.0,"I wanted to love Pure Barre. I really, really, really wanted to love Pure Barre. I moved to New Orleans from a city where Bar Method (a similar type of workout) was incredibly popular, and because I had gotten myself addicted to it (seriously!), I was really excited to find Pure Barre here.  In theory, Pure Barre is a phenomenal workout that will lengthen muscles and lift and tone everything. The substance of the class is a combination of ballet, pilates, yoga, and strength work. It definitely helps to have a dance background, or at least some level of body awareness, but it's not necessary. It is similar to Bar Method (opening soon in Covington but not in New Orleans yet) and Xtend Barre (two New Orleans locations).  My main problem with Pure Barre is that the instructors don't give form corrections - which may seem like a minor point, but when you're doing the small, isometric movements that are the key to the class, it's very important to have proper form. Otherwise, you don't get the full benefit of the exercise, and you could even hurt yourself. Unfortunately, Pure Barre places almost no emphasis on form. Yes, the teachers will occasionally remind the class to keep proper form, but they do not give any individual corrections. Because of this, in the classes I've taken, over 50% of the class will have incredibly poor form at any given time...and they probably don't even know it! I am a former dancer with a lot of experience in this type of class, but even I sometimes am not sure whether my form is right - in Bar Method, I relied on instructors to correct me, but in Pure Barre, I just feel like a fool going through the movements in what's possibly a completely improper way.   What I also dislike about Pure Barre - and really, this is more me missing Bar Method than disliking PB - is that the instructors aren't as enthusiastic or encouraging as I feel like they could be. Bar Method teachers encourage each student by name, giving positive feedback when it's deserved. Pure Barre teachers do this once in a blue moon. As a suggestion, to any of the teachers reading this, a little motivation really goes a long way!  My other main problem is the price - at $25 a class, and $225 for a month of unlimited classes, Pure Barre is one of the most expensive workouts I've ever heard of, especially in New Orleans. The new client special of $100 for an unlimited month of classes is a good deal, but after that, I don't think it's worth it.  The instructors at Pure Barre are all very nice, and Pure Barre COULD be a great workout, but it just isn't there yet. I'll wait for Bar Method to open in Covington instead.",Shopping

I decided to order a caesar salad after I asked what was on the farm salad and the lone counter server had a difficult time answering such a routine question. He said it was ""just stuff from the garden down the street"" and mentioned carrots, beets and watermelon. The boy was nice, but to be honest he was not very helpful.  The caesar salad was nothing special, and it wasn't even made in house. I watched the chef bring it in from College Inn across the parking lot. He handed it right to me after walking through the front door. I hope that was an aberration. There's no reason not to prepare things fresh on site.

Let me start by saying the salesman was very nice and helpful through the process especially with the many revisions we had and are happy with the quality of our purchase. But understand that once you have purchased your cabinets from campbell and possibly other cabinet only suppliers, it is your responsibility to install them yourself or obtain the services of a contractor to install them (something we we not told till time to seal the deal) and if you are spending say $30,000 and up on cabinets with lots of detail you will need to have an experienced installer do the job. This is where the quandary is. If you are buying from a big box store or any supplier that provides installation, they will provide you with a contractor (at a cost up front at the time of purchase i'm guessing) and If there is a problem with installation such as missing, incorrect parts, or ill fitting cabinets they will confer with the store or supplier to correct the problem or if you are unhappy later with a problem you have discovered, the store or supplier will assume the responsibility to correct it even if the problem was the contractors fault.  If you purchase cabinets at one place then hire someone on your own to do the install and then run into a problem of one blaming the other, leaving you to referee the deal and later on if a problem arises good luck having one or the other take responsibility. It's like ordering a automobile in parts and either the factory assembles it or you hire a mechanic to put it together. In our case sometimes the contractor contacted campbell's but sometimes we were left trying to be the go between. Don't think a installer won't ruin some expensive trim only to claim it was never delivered leaving you to deal with the supplier who can show you on the invoice that it was delivered. See where i'm going with this. All this being said i am not saying not to use campbell's, just that quality and price being the same if you could purchase cabinets from a place that is responsible for installation you would have a lot less headaches. Also know this, if you are getting crown on your ceiling height cabinets and are also running your own crown in rest of the house, they will not match where they meet at and most of these types cabinets are generic in that they don't accomomodate just any sink and range top. you will have to do some retrofitting. something my installer thought wasn't his job, so i had to do it. and don't settle for a 10 inch overhang on your bar countertop, it's useless  .

Maybe it's cause I had high expectations already since apparently one of their menu items was on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" for Emeril?  Anyway, we shared a Bahn Mi, and I asked for no mayo on half the sandwich cause I personally strongly dislike mayo on anything. When we got our sandwich, there was mayo on the whole thing, and when we tried to ask what happened, one of the ladies in the kitchen said it's good with the mayo so that's why she didn't take it off and for me to just eat it with the mayo. Umm... I know I don't like it, and it's not my first viet sandwich, so I wasn't really too happy with eating something that I know wasn't my preference...  So then we got our main dishes. My bf had the pho ga [pho with chicken; the dish that Emeril proclaimed was one of the best things he ever ate], and he was pretty disappointed, but at least his stomach felt better after (he had a stomach ache). I tried the chicken in the pho, and it was, again, meh.

The chicken tasted like it was reheated at least once and it wasn't even warm when I got it. Now even worse, the staff refused to refund the balance of my half of the order onto my card.

Fine. Ugly is on the name. What can be expected? Some toddler was banging on a piano by the entrance. After having to go to the bar to order, I asked the bartender what she recommended. She said ""anything."" To narrow it down, I asked which of the sandwiches. Again...""anything."" Oooookay. I'll have a burger cooked medium-well with only lettuce and cheddar. I asked for fries instead of chips. ""We don't have a fryer."" The other two got ""Today's Special"": a chili dog. Theirs came out in a couple minutes.   After twenty minutes, I went up to the area where you go to pick your food. I then saw three microwaves. No sign of a grill. Just three microwaves and a smoker. I watched them microwave not only the hot dogs, but also my macaroni and cheese, some person's chick breast, sausage, the chili, some cheese sauce, a bottles bbq sauce, and my hamburger. They then proceeded to put some sort of cole slaw, pepper jack cheese, and other things on my burger. I told them I only asked for lettuce and cheese but to now just trade it for a chili dog. The man said that the hot dogs take some time to grill so it will be a while. Oh, like the twenty minutes it took you to microwave the burger?   The chili dog came out about 5-10 minutes later. Chili tasted like it was from a can. Hot dog had no grill marks but was a Nathan's hot dog, so it's hard to screw up.   Bathroom was disgustingly dirty. Toilet was overflowed and soap dispenser was empty.   Stay away.",Restaurants

The picadillo taco and burrito I had seemed pretty bland and lacking in flavor to me.  The chicken options seemed to bring more to the flavor experience.  The chips and salsa were complementary and alright but the salsa could have used a bit more spice for my taste.  Service was a bit on the slower side and it took longer than it should have several times to get my drink refilled.  Overall it doesn't seem to bring very much new to the already overcrowded Magazine Street Tex-Mex selection.

His mother made the reservation and also let the restaurant know that there would be one vegan in attendance.  I must that say that I was pleasantly surprised at both the outstanding menu accommodations and the excellent food itself!  The staff were very careful and deliberate in making sure my food was, in fact, vegan, and they served me with huge smiles, despite my being ""the difficult one"" at the event.  As an alternative to the gumbo opener, I was served a tomato-based soup that was warm and delicious, with just a bit of Cajun kick!  My salad was just an altered version of what the other got.  When I pointed to the dressing and asked what it was, I was politely informed of its ingredients.  I was served a vegetable curry in lieu of the shrimp dish and beef tenderloin dish the other guests got.  This curry was delicious!  I'm not going to lie, I was a little skeptic of a Creole/Cajun place making Indian food, but damn it; they nailed it!  My desert was raspberries, strawberries and blackberries served in a martini glass.  These berries tasted like they were literally picked off out of the garden ten minutes prior, rinsed and then given to me.  The only real ""complaint"" that I have doesn't even have anything to do with me, but my tablemate had to ask several times for a refill of his water, and it took almost twenty minutes for that to happen.  However, I credit the large group and server distractions for the delay.  Based on their excellence in general, I wouldn't hold this as an indicator of their service.  When I return to New Orleans, I will definitely be visiting Café Adelaide again.  Clean restaurant, delicious food and an informed and caring staff.  I highly recommend this place.

I never have to wait for a machine, one of the good things about living in a not-very-fitness-minded city. The place is always super clean and smells really good (really...I don't know what air freshener they use but it's quite effective). All the cardio machines have TVs and iPod hook-ups on them so you're not bored to tears while working out. The best thing about it is it's NOT a meat market.

1093,Magasin Vietnamese Cafe,29.9209952,-90.0991277,17.0,"As many other yelpers have stated, I've been dying for this place to open since I moved in around the corner. They finally opened during the course of the week leading up to Mardi Gras, and I couldn't be more excited for it.   Walking into the Magasin, you'll get a very upscale, trendy vibe to the place. Everything is sleek and new, and quite impressive. I'm a fan of their lighting, but that's another story.   I was salivating at the menu upon first glance. I settled on their Pho my first go around, and I was so very satisfied. Their presentation is flawless, and their amazing food just makes the whole experience even more delightful. Yes, they may only have one size to their Pho bowls, but to be honest, that could be the least of my concerns. I've since gone back and tried numerous menu items - among my favorites are the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, the Grilled Shrimp Spring Rolls, and the BBQ Pork Vermicelli Noodle Bowl. Tasty, Tasty, Tasty.   At the moment, they're still in their first few weeks of being open. They have a delightful owner (who even let my roomie and I be served before they opened for dinner the other day!), and staff who are very eager and apologetic for mistakes made. I haven't had a problem waiting for my food, as all of the times I have gone there, my food has been brought to me in under 10 minutes. I've had to wait longer at numerous other restaurants, so I don't see the wait for food as an issue.   Cost wise, Magasin is super affordable, with most meals costing under $10. I love meals that don't break my bank and Magasin caters to these needs.   A few tips - Magasin is BYOB (no corking fees), they do take-out, avoid the busy hours of the day (i.e. 12pm, 6-7ish). I haven't had a problem yet rolling in around 5:30, right when they start up dinner, or a little after the lunch crowd.   To make a long story short, this is my new go to Pho shop. It may not be like those Pho shops on the westbank, but I've fallen in love with Magasin, and will continue to visit this darling shop frequently.

I wanted to reserve a table for a party of 10 and decided to call them a week prior (Saturday). I was told to call back the upcoming Wednesday for a reservation. Let's back it up a bit: I called them about a month prior to the actual event just to get some details about reservations. I was given a presumably complete rundown. Fast-forward: I called Wednesday and was told I'd have a manager call back. No return call. I called around 12 times between Wednesday and Thursday with no answer. I was persistent because this was the only local hookah bar that seemed to our liking. By Friday, I finally got a response in which I was informed that in order to reserve, I would have to physically come in and purchase a bottle. That was a definite inconvenience because the person who would actually have to pay was now out of town. So, I gave it a chance and told my party to just see if they could go in when Saturday arrived. I stayed back due to illness. The place was really packed according to the birthday boy. He assumed he had reservations there, which he somehow didn't comprehend when I explained everything to him. However, when he mentioned my name to the owner or manager, he remembered our conversation and my persistence and decided to seat them within a short time frame. I got word of the staff's super friendliness and their rush to accommodate them. Perhaps they realized that phone activity could have been a bit better on their behalf.

1271,The Paris Room,29.9565785,-90.0667025,4.5,"My parents discovered the Paris Room and fell in love immediately. Jessyka provided excellent customer service and a perfect contract. They signed on the spot and paid the balance in full for a ceremony reception for my wedding.  A couple of months later, we received a very disgruntled email from Jessyka about how she had to leave the company due to many reasons and just wanted to let her clients know that she was available to talk through anything necessary to make the transition better for our events.  After that, there was quite a bit of trouble with the new rep on behalf of the owner. My emails and calls weren't answered or returned and when I went to the restaurant a month before my wedding to try to work out details, I was told I needed to make an appointment. After about 20 minutes, they agreed to just go ahead and meet with me then.  Three weeks before the wedding, I received a phone call stating that even though we had a signed contract that promised 135 chairs, they would only be able to accommodate us if we paid a fee of $400-500.   My fiancé pushed back on the terms of the signed legal contract. She then said we would have the chairs and they would make it work.   The day before my wedding the rep called and said that they were ordering less chairs because the space wasn't big enough to accommodate my guests and that 30 of them will have to stand in the back of the room.  The night of the rehearsal dinner, I was reminded that my dog wasn't written into the contract after being told that she was allowed to walk in the wedding.  It was a stressful and unfortunate lead up to the wedding, but the ceremony itself was beautiful and perfect. The space was great, we ended up getting all of our chairs at no additional charge and they even set up a really nice area in the courtyard for formal photos before the ceremony.  Would I recommend? Probably not. But our wedding couldn't have been more perfect in the end.",Restaurants

My brother and his wife ordered the lobster plate which was the main reason we drove out to the east from Metairie. 45 min later (and after my son and I finished eating) they just decided to cxl their order.

The sauce was delicious but the bun was completely soaked and broke down as I was eating the sandwich. The Parish Chick was a bit too sweet for my liking, I thought cajun honey would make it have a kick but it was really sweet. The Hot Chick had a thai chili sauce and it tasted like the stuff you get out of a bottle at the store. It was okay, but not great. The amount of fries you get in an order is crazy.

Let's start at the beginning... last year I  for some unknown reason used Ponds Cold Cream in place of my normal moisturizer and I had a HORRIBLE reaction. I'd just moved here and hadn't really established a system of  care yet... so a quick google search of esthetician's in the area led me to Queendom. I called and the spoke to the owner Melissa and she told me to come in right away so she could have a look. She took one look at my skin and told me EXACTLY what was going on, gave me a small sample of her bar soap and I purchased one. It was so soothing and calmed my skin within 2 days time.       Everything goes back to normal I'm back using my regular Aveeno products and out of nowhere my skin just starts being freaking WEIRD and disrespectful!    This time I tell myself I'm going to stick with her line of products... it's been 3 weeks and I have not a single regret. I mean who knew washing your face was something to look forward to!  I love how all the bars lather and don't dry me out. The sugar exfoliant gently gets rid of all the pesky blackheads and the brightening serum just feels so damn good and isn't heavy.

I walked in the pouring rain from Canal Place to Fleurty Girl, only to find out they were closed due to bad weather, which wouldn't have been a problem, except I could see the cashier sitting eating at her desk. Assuming it was the person I had spoken to, and keeping in mind it was just after they had closed, I was hoping she could let me in to pay for the Water Meter Mat that I was looking for. I knocked, and she looked up at me, and continued to eat. I then called the store, which she looked at me, while she ignored the call. I was frustrated, so I started to walk back to my car. She came, opened the door, and said ""we're closed due to bad weather.""  To which I responded ""I'm the one who called earlier about the Water Meter Mat."" To which she responded with an amazing attitude about how she couldn't help me and ""the ONLY reason she even answered the door was because she could see me calling"", and when I suggested she was being quite rude considering I walked in the pouring rain, she said ""I'm not being rude. I'm gonna not be rude now."" and slammed the door.

Now for the food. I didn't go to the pop up when it was there, and I was very excited to eat the food. I am Filipino and I understand that everyone makes each signature Filipino dish differently. The food presentation was very good. But I would still encourage the chefs and the owner to punch up the menu; an issue I have with many asian restaurants in town is that they dilute the flavors that should be in the food. I had the lumpia shanghai [good stuffing but a bit limp in texture], chicken adobo [good portion size but needed to be marinated longer since the flavors of the sauce did not permeate the meat much], and milkfish [fried preparation and again, it needed more marinade flavor]. I can understand that Filipino flavors can be a love it or hate it thing and being a new restaurant, they're still figuring it all out. But if you are gonna have a Filipino restaurant, then make the unique flavors explode as they should. That's what makes Filipino food amazing.

Seating all along the three sides of the bar. The Inn is bright with tv's everywhere( Waaaaay to many for me, but if its your thing...). The place is clean, the staff is very friendly and they have frequent specials.     The kitchen is open until midnight, 2 AM on Fridays and Saturdays. The food is real solid pizza/ pub grub at a reasonable price. Now the place has a bit of an ill feel to it, with all the tvs, the brightness, the decor, just makes it seem like your drinking in an 80's video game parlor. They pour short, which is obviously a HUGE issue. There is an internet Juke box, which I believe is the WORST invention to ever plague a bar. There is Waaaaay to much plastic being used here, not much glass, which again is just lending to the automated inhuman feel of the place.      Seeing that it is walking distance to my place, I shall frequent here now and again. I am sure I will become known by their kitchen staff.

2056,The Old Coffee Pot Restaurant,29.9581581,-90.0651605,16.0,"I'm terribly disappointed to see how badly this place has declined. It seems that since they were featured on the Food Network they think they are celebrities, and that they are doing you a favor by allowing you to dine there. I lived in New Orleans for ten years pre-Katrina, and had remembered the Coffee Pot as a charming, old-school restaurant with great food and friendly service. I was shocked at how poorly we were treated, and embarrassed that I brought my friends there, some of whom had never been to New Orleans before.   I would like to begin by saying that I have worked in the restaurant industry my entire life, I am beyond patient and understanding when dining out, but there is absolutely no excuse for the way we were treated. We went for brunch on Sunday, 3/1. There was a bit of a line, but it was moving quickly so we decided to wait. What a mistake! As we got closer to the front, we were greeted by a surly hostess who seemed annoyed that we were there. She asked how many were in our party, gave us a severe look, and disappeared.   We were eventually sat at a table with no menus and waited. And... waited. For a long time. Eventually a waitress shuffled over. At this moment my friend had been showing me a photo on her phone, and our waitress barked at us in a caustic tone to, ""Put your toys away."" She dropped menus on our table and disappeared without taking a drink order.   Again we waited. We had more than enough time to read the entire menu, decide what we wanted to eat and drink, even had time leftover to discuss the weather, this year's Jazz Fest lineup, and the meaning of life. When our waitress finally returned with water, she again admonished us to put our ""toys"" away, and vanished without taking a drink or food order.   We continued to wait helplessly, and at this point I'm getting annoyed. Any restaurant that's been open this long should know well enough that a drink order should have been taken by now. After we'd been sitting for nearly 25 minutes, we looked around for our waitress and realized that she was just standing in the window of the kitchen, waiting for food to come up.   Now look, the place was not understaffed. There were three waitresses on the floor and what appeared to be a hostess that was helping bus tables and make drinks. The place is tiny, and the outdoor seating was closed save for two tables. They were full, but not even close to being busy enough to justify such slow service, although as another reviewer mentioned, the entire staff has a serious lack of time-management skills. Even harder to justify, however, is the attitude we were getting from everyone.   I finally went over to the kitchen/bar area and asked the woman behind the bar if someone could take our food and drink order. She didn't seem too interested in helping me, but did ask who our waitress was. At this point, our ""waitress"" turned around and asked in a hostile tone, ""What's the problem over there?""  Excuse me? What's the problem? The problem is that it's been almost a half an hour since I sat down and I'd like to order something to eat and drink! She yelled at me that she was waiting for another table's food to come up and that when it was ready and she had dropped it off, she would be over to take our order. ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME??   After almost ten more minutes she came over to take our order, and hostilely asked us for ID when we ordered alcoholic beverages. She did manage to take our food order at the same time, however she made several mistakes with our entire order, including bringing potatoes when we asked for grits and forgetting to bring a beverage my friend had ordered. She also had to come back because she forgot what side dish we had ordered. She made a lame attempt to try to backpedal on her former hostility, but the damage was done. I will give credit where credit is due, the food was good enough, the grits were fantastic, although they had clearly used frozen spinach on my eggs sardou, and the hollandaise was bland.   Here's the final insult, they had the nerve to add an 18% gratuity to our bill, and we were only a party of four! This was not stated ANYWHERE on the menu, trust me, I looked at the menu again to check. The fact that they were adding gratuity explains the poor service, it also explains the I-don't-give-a-shit attitude from the staff. If my one friend hadn't had to get to the airport for her flight, I would have called the manager and refused to pay the gratuity, because it is ILLEGAL to add a service charge to a bill without advance notice, they can't force you to pay it! I told the hostess how unhappy we were, she didn't seem to care.  All in all, it was a very disappointing experience. My friends who still live in New Orleans agree that the Coffee Pot has really gone downhill in recent years, especially since their Food Network ""fame."" The sad thing is that there will probably always be tourists gullible enough to go because they saw it on TV! Be warned, stay away!",Restaurants
215,August Moon Chinese Restaurant,29.9260216,-90.0943309,17.0,"I don't eat a ton of Chinese takeout because I haunt various local Asian markets and buy and cook the stuff myself. But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.  My order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.  For some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.  Their online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are ""prepared with vegetarian ingredients"", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't. So I appreciate that notification, and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time I decide I want Chinese takeout.",Restaurants

The last couple times, had the good fortune to meet the other half of the staff that take 15 mins to take your order, are rude when you ask where the food is (had a waitress nicely blurt out, ""It's coming!"") or just forget about you.  The food is good enough and their variety is well worth checking out.  The K&B sandwich is delicious.  Went in there recently and they were short staffed again with much of the same results....getting lost in the shuffle with the other tables (even though we had arrived first) and all around slow service.

But with the benefit of a group-on, I dropped in on Desi Vega's Steakhouse and had an excellent meal.  We made reservations for 8 p.m. on a Friday evening with just a few days lead time, so it's not packed, but clearly did need the reservations. Parking was a little challenging, but not awful, and I could have used valet if I was so inclined. The manager was very helpful from the start; we were a bit early, but we ordered drinks and when the table was ready quickly, they simply brought the drinks to our table. It's a relatively small place with windows all around that look out on Lafayette Square and St. Charles Avenue. I wouldn't say it's a romantic place at all, but a nice place with some ""buzz"" going on. I'm thinking it's the type of place where people like to be seen. It was loud, but not overwhelming and the tables had good space between them, so you had privacy. As far as atmosphere, I would give it a 23 out of 30 - and most of the points come off because of my own preference for a little more relaxed of an atmosphere.  Jumping into the food, it was very good. I had a filet, which was pricey ($41) but very good. I added the crab meat and asparagus (thumbs up) as well. The meat comes on a crazy sizzling hot plate; the sizzling meat sound with the smell is always a good thing. One key thing is that vegetarians can eat here! There are a handful of options, so don't be scared by the ""steakhouse"" name. The Mac and cheese was considered a specialty of the place, but I wasn't impressed, nothing bad, just nothing spectacular. One of the appeals was that they have Pappy Van Winkle (15-year). It was $26 for a glass and it was very tasty. Overall on food, I will give this a 42 out of 50. All was very good, but nothing blew me away.  The service was top-notch. I'm not even sure how it could be any better. We were seated very quickly, nearly exactly at 8 p.m. We had multiple waiters and everything was prompt without seeming rushed. I'm trying to knock points off, but the only issue might have been a little wait to actually get the bill - but in some ways, that's appreciated, they weren't looking to run us out. I'll give it a 19 out of 20 for service.  Final score = 84. (I created a restaurant ranking system which includes a total of 100 points: 50 for food, 30 for atmosphere and 20 for service).",Restaurants

We wandered in because we couldn't find anywhere else.   It's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.  We sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.  I ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning.   Our waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks.

Every delivery person I have ever had is so nice and always on time (if you schedule a specific delivery time), the pizza and sides are always very fresh and hot and the prices are good too. On one occasion, the deliveryman forgot the drinks that I ordered with my pizza. He was so sweet and apologetic about it. He drove to the store right away and brought them to us pronto. All in all, I like the employees, the pizza is great (way better than Domino's in my opinion) and the prices are average. No complaints here!",Restaurants

I had the Guatemalan -- black beans, eggs, avocado and a tortilla; my husband had a chili cheese omelet. Service was not terrible but our server wasn't very interested, and didn't come back to ask how we were doing.

For real, I could eat a whole plate of these myself. Everything about this dish was delicious and the shrimp were soooo fresh.   For a main I decided to get the Banh Cuon which was very similar to the rice roll we got as an appetizer. It was delicious but I preferred the sauce with the appetizer more. My partner got the Dan Dan which was overall good but the broth lacked some flavor - needed more salt for sure, though overall not bad.

However, I have to say that my medium rare burger came out badly overcooked and was much beyond well done.  The red peppers I had on the burger were delicious and if the burger wasn't so dried out I'd say it was delicious and very reasonably priced.

The food is expertly prepared and extremely creative.  They seem to specialize in pastries with interesting combinations of ingredients, for example today I had a savory tart with wild mushrooms and cheese, and there were tomato tarts and also one with beets that looked yummy. The mushroom tart I ate today was rich, buttery, and delicious. Of course, it's a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good.  They have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods:  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on Twitter and Facebook, it's haunting me and I might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow.  They also make their own bagels, which is super exciting for this born-and-raised-New Yorker. Everything is made fresh every day, I was told by the friendly, helpful man who waited on me at the counter.  The place itself has a nice, clean, modern decor. It's a long, narrow space with the pastry counter-cash register towards the back, and about six or seven small tables running down the length of the room, with chairs and a comfortable bench with pillows. I didn't stay long today, but it looks like the type of place you could go hang out and drink coffee for a while, or go have lunch with a friend.    I don't even live Uptown, but I hope to become a regular at this place!

The area is adorned with a fountain, benches, a palm & beautifully shaped shade tree, as well as, two large cabanas. The room itself is a bit tight, but has a futuristic and clean design that adds a bit of a wow factor while differentiating itself from others.

I learned more about agave and how it relates to tequila during a short seminar than I learned during my lifetime.   El Tesoro is a remarkably tasty tequila that takes tequila crafting seriously. It's not only a quality tequila, but it is also a brand that sources agave responsibly. I had no idea that this coveted plant was over harvested to the point where it threatened the environment. The long-nose bat, the tiny mammal responsible for pollinating agave plants has reportedly recovered from near extinction, in part because of the efforts of responsible agave harvesters. The bat requires mature plants to pollinate, so El Tesoro allows 5% of their harvest to mature in order to protect this precious species. Even if it means they reduce their profit in the process. Now, that's something to toast to!  Following the seminar, I was invited to attend the Night in Paradiso event which was a blast! I was able to sample many varieties of El Tesoro, and I even made my own cocktail rim of herbs to take home. The night was enhanced by the smooth sounds of the Vivas band, and a delicious cooking demo by Restaurateur of the Year Edgar Caro!

I've attended the TBC and the Barre Code class.... so far!  The studio has more of a gym-ey feel to it, but in a way that demonstrates they know their audience and creates a fun, working-out community. They have lockers available and socks for sale. The studio itself is long mirrored room, so you have space on the barre no matter the size of the class. The instructors have microphones and actively adjust the music and lighting. It was all very professional.  Both classes were high energy. The emphasis is on making the most of your time there, and I've both classes were very effective & efficient. TBC incorporates cardio... which is my favorite part of anything. The transitions between cardio and strength were very smooth -- again it all seemed very professional and smooth. Oh, they also made good use of the equipment in class, so if you want to be more challenged, there's a lots of opportunity for that!  I'm all about people getting the right workout in for them. For me, I felt like I needed a little more stretch time between segments and if I were brand new, I may have needed more personal guidance than was available with the microphone. However, I will definitely be incorporating Barre Code into my workout options.

They have lots of small plates and we were ordered a bunch for the table and shared everything (my favorite way to eat). I am vegetarian, so I was pleased that they had lots of veggie options between appetizers, sides, and mains. I had the roasted vegetable polenta, which was amazing.

I took the sandwich back to the counter and said ""I wanted romaine not these greens."". I think they made me a new sandwich--this time with even less turkey and feta cheese and the guacamole on the side (which I suggested they do).  What a complete ripoff.

Tried castellon and got the manager. He said he might have some, put me on hold and searched and searched to find it. When he finally did he realized that it was expired and he wouldn't be able to sell it.

Products: What you might typically find at any of these big box pharmacy chains---OTC medicines, Rx medicines, beauty products, supplements, photography accessories, snacks, etc. There are usually well-stocked, and their prices not unreasonable. 3 stars  Service: The management has definitely imparted the importance of the greeting when a customer enters the establishment. There's at least one cashier working at any time, but sometimes 2 during busier times, a security guard is almost always present, some pharmacy staff in the back, and they have ""doc-in-a-box"" service available for those requiring quick, non-emergency care. 3 stars  Facilities: A typical brick-and-mortar, flattop building you'd expect from this chain. There is ample private lot parking, and a drive through for the pharmacy. The major issue I've noted with the outside is the trashcan is not emptied often enough. Other than that, the exterior is quite nice. The inside is aisled, with the medical services in the rear. There is nothing really remarkable to say about the interior. It's usually tidy, though. 3 stars  Overall: This is a regular stop for me when I require a pharmacy.

I'd try it again, with instructions for less sugar. The oysters were decadent. Confession: 1st time having charbroiled ones. I love the raw bivalve, and this was a treat.   The tartar would use some tweaking. The presentation is fine; however, the tuna should be diced finer and the avocado is not really a great addition. I wasn't sure is the accompanying sauce was just soy, or ponzu. Was the sauce on the plate wasabi-based? All these things detracted from the tuna.   The hot bread with butter is delicious. But the bread served w/the appetizers is overkill. The bread w/the oysters is traditional, although you can't sop up sauce using toast points. I'd look for another option for the tartar.

He was not only very polite but excited to give me a crash course on the subject.  He took me into the humidor where they had both the cigars that were aging and not yet for sale as well as those that could be purchased and smoked.  The general rule is that the flavor of a cigar will continue to improve for up to ten years  However most cigars will be aged for 3 months to a couple of years.

Also, because I was on a club floor I had an amazing view of the city.  The club floors are highest floors in the hotel.  (There are 49 floors; I stayed on the 47th floor.)  The hotel was also a great place for our conference.  We had plenty of space for all the events, and the conference rooms were nice.  Plus, the Sheraton has a great location on Canal Street, so it's a short walk to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter.  Here's the bad, and the reason for the 3 star rating.  The wifi in the hotel isn't that great.  I stayed 4 nights and had to reconnect every 24 hours.  The reconnection process was super slow and would sometimes kick me off the wifi for hours.  So, that was obviously a huge inconvenience.  When I checked out, I complained to the front desk staff about the wifi and was credited 500 Sheraton points.

I realize all the prices of items in the mini bar are generally outrageously expensive, but it still would have been nice to have the option, especially when the hotel requests for its guests not to bring outside alcohol into the hotel.  It just doesn't make sense.  If you don't want us to get it elsewhere, then supply us with it to begin with.     Third, false charges made to my room.  When I went to check out I was told that I had been emailed a copy of my bill.  That's great.  I love having a copy I won't lose, but the server was down, and the bill wasn't sent.  So, I asked for a hard copy.  When I got it, I noticed a mysterious room service charge on my bill that I didn't make.  I was told to call Sheraton customer service to dispute the charge.  I have dealt with Sheraton customer service before and they have always routed me back to the individual hotel because the call center doesn't have authority to make certain decisions.  I knew if I was going to get the charge removed it would be when I was checking out with a live person standing in front of me.  At my insistence that she show me the room service bill, the front desk lady finally left to hunt it down.  After 20 minutes she returned and apologized because no bill could be produced.  It really makes me wonder if something sketchy was happening.  If someone had accidently charged something to my room because their room number was similar, wouldn't a bill be available for me to see?  Regardless the charge was removed, so I was happy about that.    I appreciated the gestures to make amends for the mistakes (mysterious room service charges & spotty wifi), but I it's still annoying to have to take extra time to prove I'm not a liar.  I might come back here again, but with so many other choices of hotels in the area, I probably won't.",Restaurants

We ordered the popcorn catfish appetizer, I ordered a breakfast po boy with bacon and the eggs over easy and my girlfriend ordered the St. Ann benedict. I had a coffee and my girlfriend had the French quarter coffee (coffee with Baileys, Kahlua and whipped cream).   The coffee was fine, aside from the fact that there was no regular sugar on our table or the tables around ours. The French quarter coffee was incredible, much better than a normal ""Irish coffee.""  The popcorn catfish tasted good and wasn't overly battered. However, the menu said that it came with a ""variety of sauces."" In this case a variety meant ""more than one"" as it came out with only tartar sauce and a (wonderful) cocktail sauce.   The po boy was an awful abomination of a breakfast sandwich. The bread was awful, it was slathered in mayonnaise (mayo for breakfast - no thanks, ever). I know that po boys are typically dressed in mayo but the menu made no mention of this.   The St. Ann benedict was equally terrible. Lacked any recognizable flavor. The toast was not run through a toaster, or if it was, it wasn't in there long enough to make the transition from bread to toast. And the pathetic four forkfuls of breakfast potatoes came out cold.   Missy, the barmaid, was very nice and took some pictures of us.

If you do, you need to rent from these guys.  We had decided to rent bikes pretty early on and had already stopped by a few bike rental/tour companies to check on pricing and quality of the bikes.  When we found these guys it was a no brainer to go with them.   1. Great prices : $25 for three hours, $30 for 8 hours, and $35 for a 24 hour period.  We went with the 24 hour rental which was perfect since we never felt rushed and had plenty of time to see the whole city. The also have after hour returns so you can or pretty much return the bikes whenever you want.  Tip: when we were there they had a check in offer for 10% off. Good way to save a couple bucks.  2. Great bikes: all the bikes seemed brand new (plus made in America) and were very well taken care of and super comfortable. They are pretty large cruisers that would be bad if there were any hills in the city but are perfect for the super flat city of New Orleans. They also have super cushiony seats and some have baskets perfect for carrying purses and other things.   Tip: the men's bicycle seats are way more comfortable that the women's. They don't have baskets on them but, if you are a girl, it may be worth going with a guys bike for the better seats. Some of the roads are pretty bumpy.  3. Great service: Teddy,  the office manager and tour guide, was super helpful and took his time to map out all the major attractions, the roads we should take, the areas we should avoid, and plenty of recommendations of great restaurants.   His knowledge was invaluable and saved us a lot of time. It was also nice basically having a tour route mapped out for you.  He was also just a super nice guy.

It's the kind of service where you're praying to see someone on the wait staff so you can get a drink refill because you finished your drink 15 minutes ago.    Food-wise, I got the breakfast fried rice, and my shrimp were so salty they were inedible--I actually had to spit the first one into my napkin.  My partner's shrimp, on the other hand, had no salt (how does this happen?!), and one was uncooked.  I did not (and frankly COULD NOT) eat my meal because of the salt issue.  The three other people at my table tried a bite of my meal and were similarly shocked by the salt.  None of us has never experienced something this ""off"" in a meal.  It went way beyond the ""it's a little salty"" to ""holy crap I might be sick because something is so wrong with what I just took a bite of.""  I politely told the waitress that she may want to let the cook know something was wrong with the salt level, and she said she was sorry and would let the manager know.  Then I got the bill and the shrimp were still on the tab, no one offered us even a free slice of pie or said ""Hey sorry you paid $94 for brunch and two of the four people couldn't eat their food,"" nothing.  I don't like giving a bad review on here, but I felt like I'd been taken advantage of or scammed almost.

Being that we were not told the policies we proceeded to try and order drinks and asked if one of the TVs could be changed to view another game.  That wasn't an issue.  The issue came when i asked for a drink after trying to sort through life in this establishment and the bartender said i had to run a tab.  I have already been sitting here why wasn't that the first thing you said?  So we had to go back to the table.  Fine!  We get to the table where we sit for another 15 waiting for service.  To say service was slow would be a disservice.  To say we were overlooked would be spot on. We constantly asked for items that were brought to us 30 minutes later or only after asking a 2 or 3rd time.  Not only did our waitress, Maria, not service our table we had to get help from other workers to locate her.  I hope she doesn't work on tips.

I also ordered the house greens on the side ($3), which were cooked and seasoned well with a vinegary taste and pork hock. My boyfriend said they tasted like the greens he used to eat in North Carolina.  The deliciousness of the mussels tied with the sweet potato croquettes ($7). They were so amazingly crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. The pairing of a salted plum jam was SO delicious and inspired. Even my boyfriend liked it and he usually hates jams and jellies.  The only item that didn't impress us as much was the pork and bacon terrine ($9). I thought it had a good flavor, similar to andouille. In the restaurant's defense, it may just be that I don't care for terrine. I liked it a lot more than the texture of pate (more similar to sausage), but wasn't a big fan of the cold chewiness. My boyfriend who is a big charcuterie nerd liked it less than I did. But if you are a terrine fan in general, you would probably enjoy it.  Bonus points for our friendly and accommodating server.

Since I woke up late and missed the continental breakfast at Begue's, I had to order off the breakfast menu. I went with Eggs Sardou. Let it be known that I dislike egg yolks, let alone barely cooked, but this dish was great. Artichoke pairs so nicely with egg. I surprised myself also by liking asparagus, a food that I was sure I despised. The crunch of the spears were still there and when combined with the Hollandaise sauce, it won me over. For breakfast the next day I had waffles with strawberries. These were some of the best waffles I had ever had and, at a four star hotel, everything had better be a notch above, right?",Restaurants

It's an ""order at the counter"" type of place and they serve a few signature Cuban dishes as well as their legendary Cubano, made the classic way, as well as a vegetarian Cubano. I got the classic with pork and an order of waffle fries. I knew going in that the sandwich was pretty massive, but I had forgotten that it is PACKED to the brim with perfectly seasoned pork. It hit the spot and satisfied my months-long Cuban sandwich craving. The fries were perfect. They were extra crispy and the generous serving was shareable.  The menu is limited, but what they do, they do well. I do wish that they had plantains on the menu, but you win some and you lose some. If you miss the old Bud's Broiler that used to be located here, they got you covered and have a burger on the menu. They also have an assortment of classic Cuban cocktails, but I didn't partake because it was a weekday at lunch and I had a job to get back to.

I have seen the huge blue dog on Veterans BLVD, and the the blue dog in the sculpture garden in city park, and should have guessed there was a studio in town showing his art work.  I do like his work with the tombs of New Orleans, and the older scenes of Louisiana more than the dog, but it is like his signature. Rodrigue has passed away, but it is nice to know that he has a variety of art to carry on his legacy, and that there is a studio housing his works and selling some prints.

But as we were riding the streetcar back from the Garden District around dinnertime, we were getting hungry so I tried to make a reservation on Open Table. I saw that we were two stops away from Hummus, and that the menu looked fantastic -- so we took a chance and went to this place.  I'm so glad we did.  It was incredible!!!!    Please don't be fooled by the nondescript atmosphere or the small crowds.  (When we first arrived, the restaurant was empty and two friends were dining at an outdoor table.)  The food is absolutely delicious (get the lamb kebabs, salad, and the baba ganoush -- trust me!!!), the service was friendly and attentive, portions were generous (I ate as much as I wanted and still needed a doggy bag), and the prices were reasonable.  Also -- the restroom was clean, which is always a good sign in any restaurant.  I truly can't say enough good things about this place.

Don't go here for food!!! Horrible experience. If I could give zero stars I would!  We were seated at a table near the live band. Our host asked a busboy to come wipe our table off. When the busboy showed up he goes it looks clean to me and walked away without even wiping it down or emptying the overflowing astray on the table. Shortly after our waiter shows up and tries to get a drink order from us. They are out of so many things he said if we wanted liquor or beer it would be better for us to go to the bar. At the bar I can see plastic cups covering 75% of the beer bottles which is the universal indication they are out of those items.  Then we ask about the menu, which is small in itself and has no explanation of what anything is. Several of the items list they are only available on Friday. Then the server rattles off some other items that aren't available including the boiled seafood which is listed as that nights special. So the extremely limited menu just got cut down to 5 items to choose from and when we asked for an explanation the server didn't know what anything was or how it was prepared. The menu pictured on the business pictures here is not what we were given - it was a version that didn't even have all of that!  At that point we decided to get up and go elsewhere. Thank god we did because I had the best meal of my life at Alfondo's down the street. So skip over this place all together and get some real good creole Italian food down the street!",Restaurants

It wasn't very crowded - just a few groups on field trips at that time.   At first, I was kind of self-conscious that I went by myself, but the nice lady at the counter said that they get plenty of adult visitors who have fun there. But you know, as someone who's been studying Early Childhood Education, it was only fitting that I go, right? Why, sure.   First floor:  - Oh, come on. You know you want to touch that plasma ball.   - That rock wall? It's really for kids. I'm a little over 5 feet, and I could reach the top in two steps.   - You must see that screen with all the colors that captures your movements and poses. That is just soooo awesome. Don't be shy - dance in front of it. Jump around. You'll love it!  - Team Turtle Training Camp. That's where I sang a song about not smoking, created a well-balanced meal, and learned how to express my feelings. Yup.  - There's a mat where you can practice your *STOP, DROP, & ROLL* skills. In the same area, you can learn how to make emergency phone calls.  (Uh, no, I didn't do that.)  - I found out I can throw a baseball at 30something mph, and reaffirmed that I can't throw a football to save my life.  - The theater is nice and cozy, but I had just missed the show. I did get to take a picture with Stuffie, though. (And I'm still sad I accidentally deleted it.)  - THE PULLEYS. Those were so much fun, as was the lever and this other corner where you can capture your shadow. (Tip: close your eyes as the flash is about to go off, because that is freakishly bright.)   SECOND FLOOR:  - The bathroom is something spectacular.  - There's a play area for the very little kids. I'm sure if I were two years old, I would have loved it.   - I'm quite impressed by the exhibit dedicated to the eye. It's like all the information on the eye that I learned in elementary school was crammed into this place.   - As sticky as it was, I did like to play with bubbles. I didn't get to stand in this one place where you can try to enclose yourself in a giant bubble, though.  - The roleplay areas were so cool! I wish I had a big cabin, a canoe, a crane, a ship, and a cafe to play with ... even now. And that grocery store where you can actually ""go shopping"" and stand in a ""Three items or less"" line? How precious is that?  - I loved the Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood exhibit. Wow, what a fit of nostalgia that gave me. I could play in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. I could even open a closet and put on a sweater. You know, if I wanted to.   There's something so fun about acting like a kid, and this was a place where I could do just that. For a ""grown-up,"" this place would probably be boring. It may seem small, but it's probably the size of a country to some child. Say what you want, but it was like a big playground for me. I love how something so simple can bring you back to that attitude of a child, where everything is so interesting and so new.  I thought this place was great for both adults (with some use of the imagination, of course) and children, and so worth the $7 admission. If I ever find myself in New Orleans, I'd definitely visit again.  (PS - the website says you can rent the museum?!

I went here for my best friend's birthday with all of the girls and we killed the appetizers. It was that delicious. They give you cotton candy as a complimentary dessert so that was cool. Now when you go to a classy restaurant such as Dominique's you're going to expect excellent service right? Well, you get two people to serve you.

My guess is this place will be closed by next year, don't waste your money at this joke of an establishment.

""oh NO...Mexicans and ""other Latinos"" drinking at the bar""....as someone said below....seriously?   Yeah so they have different customs and of course the bartenders and waitresses are  Honduran and ""other Latino"", as someone put it.  In fact one of the girls that worked there when I went was from Dominican Rep. so she was on Island time.....it's a Latino bar/restaurant and all part of the experience.

I ordered the No. 21 cocktail, and it was perfect.    After cocktails, we were led upstairs to the second floor of the restaurant where Mario waited on us.  He is amazing and knows the menu very well.  We both got the soup of the day to start, which was a baked potato and corn chowder.  The smoky flavor from the bacon in the soup was phenomenal.    The bread was also great!  There was an option of Ciabatta or a Jalapeño corn muffin, and I opted to try both.  The Ciabatta bread was perfect for dipping into the soup, and the jalapeno corn muffin had the perfect flavor of jalapeno without being over-the-top spicy.   For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi with duck prosciutto off of the appetizer menu.  The gnocchi was made fresh and to perfection, and the duck prosciutto was delicious and unique.  I also ordered a side of the caramelized brussels sprouts, which were also delicious.  I am greatly disappointed when I order brussels sprouts, and they are not cooked enough; however, Emeril's cooked them to perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the jerk spiced lamb loin, and he really enjoyed it.    To finish off the evening, we shared the Bananas Foster for two prepared tableside.

Let me preface the following review by saying this: I love Burger King. I love it so hard. This one star rating is NOT for the type of food, the way it's prepared, or the how healthy it is. Because it's delicious. Burger King is a godsend, handed down to man from the heavens above and I will continue to eat it long after the FDA inevitably discovers that it's the cause of all human pain and suffering.  Having said that, I'm giving this Burger King a one star rating for how terrible the service is at this particular location. I know what you're thinking and no, I'm not crazy. I don't expect a lot from fast food restaurants. I'm not asking for a maitre d' to escort me to a private white table clothed booth for one while I dine on Chicken Fries accompanied only by the sounds of my own heavy breathing. I'm not even asking for the employees to smile when they pretend to give a fuck about my extra BBQ sauce packets. All I ask is that when I order drive-thru you DON'T ASK ME TO PULL AROUND AND WAIT BY THE DOUBLE DOORS.  Let me get this straight. You have two drive-thru windows. The first one is never used. Every time I've ever ordered food you tell me to pull up to the second window. After I've ordered and payed you tell me to pull up and wait in the parking lot and someone will walk my food to me. Why not just use the first window for payment so by the time I get to the second window my food is waiting for me? Just like EVERY OTHER FAST FOOD FUCKING RESTAURANT EVER???!!*_#)Y&!!!!?????!!??##@$??  What a giant ""fuck you"" to your customers to be a fast food restaurant that can't give me my shitty food through the little window the way God intended it. It's not like you're cooking it.  And I know why you're doing it, Burger King. It's because your corporate headquarters keep track of how long it takes cars to leave the drive-thru window. I'm assuming the lowest times get rewarded for their fast service. I hope you're happy pissing off your continually loyal customers.  Someone get me a McRib.",Restaurants

Hungry and a little inebriated after a Saints' win on a Sunday and mulling over what to eat, my s.o. and I decided on Kebab.  The menu comes simple; usually a pork option, a chicken, and then a falafel which can be made vegan or just vegetarian. I'm a huge falafel fan so I ordered the falafel and the s.o. ordered the gyro. The kebabs come on a flat baked bread, which I actually prefer to a pita since they can hold up to all the dressings. My falafel came with a nice heaping portion of arugula, beets, hummus, and tzatziki. The falafel didn't taste fried and had lots of flavor, so I like to think that my meal here was healthy. I think I'll probably be ordering a meat option next time because I couldn't help myself from stealing bites of the gyro kebab which was covered in a cilantro sauce. We also ordered a side order of fries, which were okay. They're thick cut fries that don't have that much crunch to them, but they do come with an addicting garlic aioli. Both the meat option and the falafel tasted extremely fresh, yet filling.   I'm hoping that they get to expand their hours soon to include weekdays, because I'm a huge fan and am loving the new affordable dining option.",Restaurants

At 9:45, we'd had one round of drinks and appetizers served to us. Yeah, I don't think that's acceptable. It was after 10pm when we got our main dishes.  The portions on half of our dishes was SMALL for what we paid. Two in our party were still HUNGRY after leaving the restaurant. If I pay $30-$35 per person for dinner, I shouldn't still be hungry.

It was an expensive (but not special) and not very welcoming cafe that actually kind of annoyed you with its brittle atmosphere and mediocrity.  I had stopped going altogether until I found myself hungover in that area one morning just  lurching towards a decent interior space with caffeine and edibles. It took me a while, in my state, to notice that they'd changed a LOT of things about the place.  It was one of those life-saving brunches where you don't really care that probably a good deal of your euphoria has more to do with the awful place you put yourself in before you got that orange chipotle sauced Huevos Rancheros and that perfect cappuccino. I've come back in better condition a number of times since then, and everything continues to be pretty lovely.

From the look of him, he earned it, working long past retirement age. I admit that I wish he would have sold the small business and kept it going in that way. De Blanc delivered drugs to the doorsteps of Bayou St. John for several decades and will be missed.

I ordered the Vinh's special beef pho with brisket,  oxtail, filet and meatball.  The meatball is nothing special, but the one medium sized oxtail was delicious as well as the 6 or 8 slices of filet.  The brisket was tasty as well.

It's amazing and a great compliment to fresh veggies and warm tortilla. The black beans are smoky and delicious and I recommend you sub shredded cabbage for lettuce for a nice change in flavor profiles. The chipotle sauce is a favorite as well. Just watch for the nickel-and-diming that can happen when you add things like sour cream and guac. It can add up quickly. Also, have the queso. It's warm and beer-y and delicious. If you're not in the mood for beer or a margarita, pair your meal with the Jamaica tea, sweetened hibiscus goodness.

Let me just say, right off the bat, the service was terrible.  There were two girls at the front counter - one was ambivalent, unfriendly, and seemed unhappy to be at work, and the other was downright rude.  The owners of this place should really take a close look at their staffing, because poor service like this can steer customers away permanently (see, e.g., Slim Goodies).  To be honest, these girls made me feel unwelcome.  However, once I received my order, all was well.  The coffee was fresh and delicious (and to update on the soymilk situation, per one review down the page, they do have it now!), and the bagel with cream cheese that I ordered was absolutely delicious and came out very quickly.  The bagels are a tad on the small side, but I'm not one for huge American-sized portions, so it didn't bother me a bit.    I do wish they fountain drinks, but as they are a new place, I will give them some leeway and hope that they add them soon.

Around two weeks ago my cell phone broke and the Verizon back home (New York) quickly got me a new one through my insurance (Asurion).  The replacement phone was sent to me down in New Orleans, but unfortunately it was not working properly.  I took it to this Verizon store and they figured out it was the sim card reader, which could not be repaired.  I had to put in a second claim with Asurion to get a second replacement phone, which came in the mail two days ago.    After I received my second replacement I was unable to get service on my phone (i.e. making and receiving calls).  I brought the phone to Verizon.  They said the reason I could not make/receive calls was because my phone line was suspended due to a ""a report that the phone has been lost or stolen"".  Immediately the Verizon staff member (Sergei) said I ""must have"" suspended my service with Verizon.  I said that I had never done that, and he reacted as if I were lying.  Next he attempted to unsuspend the service and didn't make it 10 minutes before saying that Asurion was the one that claimed I had a lost/stolen phone and that Verizon couldn't do anything about it.  I called Asurion and they told me that they did not, and do not, put in lost/stolen claims, only broken phone claims.  Not only did they not do what Verizon was accusing them of doing, but they couldn't rectify VERIZON's issue even if they wanted to.  Literally during the phone conversation with Asurion, Sergei takes the phone from me and says (regarding me) ""this guy doesn't know what he's talking about"".  At that point I had enough--this man was accusing me of suspending my own service, then saying Asurion is the reason my line was suspended and they couldn't unsuspend it for me, then that I am clueless.    At this point I asked for the supervision.  He disappeared for 15 minutes and I left the store.  Later I spoke to Verizon on the phone and it turns out that Verizon's Device Management Department mislabeled the phone as lost/stolen.  After 1.5 hours on the phone with a polite, respectful and competent Verizon member, the situation was resolved and my phone worked again.  TLDR: While I can't speak to the stock or sales aspect of this store, the customer support, in my brief experience, is awful and frankly disrespectful.  You are better off calling Verizon than walking into this store for support.  If you happen to find yourself under the same circumstances I was in, avoid Sergei at all costs.",Shopping

Also, it was too sweet for my taste, and that may be why I felt the sandwich was not that spicy. On the plus side, the chicken still managed to be well-cooked (crispy and not dry on the inside) even though it looked like they fried it beforehand and then would heat it up in an oven. Fair price for $8.  The cheese tots were okay. Not particularly crispy or crunchy, but they are generous with the cheese.

3127,New Orleans Cooking Experience,29.940659,-90.0788479,22.0,"5 stars all the way!  I can't say enough good things about this experience, and it is an experience - not a restaurant.  Here's the deal.  You are treated to an evening with a local chef  where you get to sit in the kitchen with them as they cook you a wonderful 3-4 course meal (go with Frank Brigtsen - usually Thursday evenings).  I must warn you that it is not cheap, $150 per person. But for this price you get a once in a lifetime event - in my opinion.   The evening starts early, about 5:30, at the plantation on Bayou road. Judy greets all of her guests at the door and then the fun starts. Enjoy some complimentary wine (included in the price) and relax and get to know your new dinner companions - usually a meal is for 10 people or so. Tour the plantation or simply kick back and enjoy.  Judy is a wonderful hostess and does a great job of keeping the wine flowing. ;)  Then everyone moves into the kitchen where you sit around the chef while they cook your meal for you. You have the opportunity to interact and ask questions or simply listen to their stories (Frank is a great storyteller) while chatting with your new friends.  Added bonus: Judy provides everyone copies of the recipes included in the menu so you can take notes if you'd like while the chef is preparing your meal.   Once dinner is ready you adjourn to the dining room and the feasting begins!  Definitely a special occasion venue but oh so worth the price - at least once!   I've recommended it to friends, co-workers and family over the years and I have yet to hear that anyone was disappointed in their evening.  Definitely start with one of Frank's meals though. He is a local celebrity and started his training under the famous Paul Prudhomme of K-Paul's.",Restaurants

That's not to say I like absolutely everything on the menu, but this is the first restaurant I've ever been to where even for the dishes I didn't quite enjoy, I understood why the chef did what he did. Although I may have preferred something done differently, I was able to appreciate what the chef was trying to do and see why someone else may enjoy these flavors.   I like to cook, but I have no formal culinary cooking. My palate is above average, but hardly sophisticated. With every dish here though, my taste buds were taken on a journey of flavor. Nothing is wasted here. Every item on the plate serves some purpose and flavors interact beautifully.   For instance, the pickled vegetables plate came with kettle chips and a horseradish sauce. The sauce and the kettle chips offset the acidity of the pickled items perfectly.   On the crab dish, the garnishes interacted wonderfully with the perfectly spiced meat.  I was with a friend and we ordered a bunch of small plates to share. I was initially disappointed because I saw that the plates were really small and psychologically I felt that the small portions would lead to an underwhelming meal, no matter how delicious the food was. My feeling is that if I like something, I want lots more of it, and although the food here is delicious, the size of the small plates is not intended for sharing. I admit though, after sharing an appetizer plate, three small plates, and one entree, I was filled, even though I didn't not think I was.  Service is great and they give you new plates and silverware with each course.   The restaurant is part of the Saint Hotel so is smaller than I expected - basically it just occupies some space in the lobby. But it is tastefully decorated.

As was the cooking other than the linguini (just plain undercooked, I'm Italian, I was a cook, I don't need any lessons on al dente). Other than one issue, the food was not even warm when delivered to the table.   Now pacing. Within minutes of giving the order, both starters came. Since so far our experience with NOLA is you get seriously rushed, we told the waiter we had plenty of time and slow things down. He replied no problem. Before we finished the appetizers someone from the kitchen delivered our 2 entrees. There was no room on the table for those let alone plates to eat the entrees on. Nor were any delivered. Nor was any serving wear delivered as we were sharing. Just plop the entrees down across the table from were we were sitting and leave. Viola, that's you fine dining experience. We rushed through the remainder of the appetizers, made our own space in the table, asked for clean plates and were introduced to the fact both the linguini and the pizza were stone cold. But the plates were warm, yes, odd. I could go on about the food prep as I was a cook but I'm letting it pass.   Excellent ingredients totally wasted. We ate some, paid, left.

Maybe that's the reasons behind the experience...maybe not.   1. The menu is too extensive, I feel like they need to condense it and narrow down the options. There's wings, burgers, pizza, riblets, AHI TUNA even...too much. It took me forever to decide on what to actually eat.   2. There are NO drink menus so you don't know what the beer or alcohol costs. Which would've been extremely helpful for me. I drink Jack Daniels but honestly $7 for a 6 ounce cup is NOT appealing. However, i didn't know i was paying $7 for a 6 ounce cup until I got my check. And I didn't know I was paying $6 for a Sweetwater Blue (which is also a cit overpriced, I'm used to about $3.50/$4.50).   3. The wing sauces are NOT premade before the shift. There were some sauces we wanted to test first before ordering the wings and apparently the cook in the kitchen has to make the sauce when there's an order for wings. So asking for a taste took about 10 minutes. THEN, apparently you have to PAY FOR A TASTE! Because the taste is the WINGS!!!! Like my husband & I had 5 wings land in front of us. 3 wings for the sauce i was tasting and 2 for him. ODD RIGHT?!?!? Yeah, I knew I wasn't the only one to think so. So it kinda ruined my appetite because I ordered a 5-piece wings and was full after 2 because of the taste test. It seems like that's actually giving food away ya know.   4. My total was $53.60 after taxes. Yes, for 2 people at a sports bar I paid $53.60 and we essentially got 2-5 piece wings ($5.75/each), side of fries ($3.50), 4- 6 ounce drinks ($28) and a beer ($6).

There was only my table of two and one other table during lunch hours and it still took our waitress too long to check on us. Too busy on the phone texting to wait on her table. The only expedient part of the service was the food, as most if not all of the meal was pre-prepared and microwaved upon order. The guacamole was rancid/mayo mixed and clearly out of a packaged bag. The ""house made"" tamales were dry and hardened. My friend's carne asada was gritty and over cooked.   I rarely ever review but in this occasion where the experience was as bad as the one I had, there is no choice but to voice the issues.  Please, management, it's not hard to cook delicious and authentic food TO ORDER.

Thank you for both quick fast casual service and easy takeout! Finally, thank you most of all for the superb customer service!  It's not just sandwiches, by the way. On a chilly fall day, pho was on my brain. The place was buzzing on a mid week afternoon. Clearly it's a favorite in the neighborhood and with good reason. Service is friendly and accommodating (more on this shortly) and the space is welcoming and quite open. Larger groups can be accommodated.  I ordered the vegan pho with tofu and an order of the fresh spring rolls. Both were good and what I needed (healthy, nourishing food) and what you probably need after a few days of excess (tourists, I'm looking at you). Honestly thought the pho could use some... heft, though. Noodles are plentiful, but veggies are not. Also, the tofu doesn't come tasty and fried as it does in places like Lily's, Mint and Magasin (though the really awesome counter guy who may be the owner said that I could definitely order it fried if I wanted, which is awesome). The fresh spring rolls come with a tasty peanut sauce... there was something missing in them, perhaps tofu? I've definitely had better and not sure if I'd order these again. Note to self: bring soy sauce in your bag next time, because there's none on the premises and this is a need for Yours, Truly whenever eating the tasty foods of Asia (and most other places. #addicted)  I really can't wait to return.

Now, like New York City, New Orleans has one too, and it's pretty good.   The tacos are on point. We had shrimp, fish and al pastor. Shrimps were the big winners. Quality tortillas. I usually prefer corn tortillas, but the shrimp and fish came on flour, and these were some good flour tortillas. Nice and spongy. The al pastor was a bit dry, and could have used some sauce. I don't think it's prepared on a spit in the traditional fashion. Had guac and ceviche, too, both of which were fantastic. Tacos are 4 dollars a pop.  We had mezcal margaritas, which were tasty as well. Mezcal is good, it tastes like an old boot, but in a good way. Made the margaritas stand out from the rest. Cocktails range from 8-13 dollars.

One of my dogs has severe seizure issues and is on 3 medications to control them. Two of the medications I get directly from the vet, one I have to get from a human pharmacy- diazepam. This particular location is so inconsistent on how they fill it, is unbelievable. I can't request a refill online, through the app or the automated phone service. I actually have to call and speak to a person. I understand that this is a controlled substance and an ID needs to be shown to pick it up. Sometimes they ask to see my ID, sometimes they don't. Sometimes I can give the ID number over the phone and they'll fill it and ask to see it when I pick up. Sometimes they don't ask for the ID at any point. Today I tried calling in a refill as my dog had a pretty epic seizure this morning and I was running low on the diazepam (the one medication that actually stops active seizures). I waited on hold for over 10 mins to speak to someone. I was then told that they couldn't refill over the phone as they needed to see my ID. I asked if they could fill it and I'd show my ID when I pick it up- nope, not this time. Doesn't matter that they've done it in the past, I now have to go in, request the refill, show my ID and wait.

3557,Original Sammy Seafood Restaurant,29.95845,-90.066127,3.0,"I saw a Groupon for this place and bought it without realizing that I had seen this place before. The Groupon was for $40. I knew it wouldn't go a long way with the reviews I had seen, but what the heck.   I invited my boyfriend and another girlfriend of mine to come along.   My first disappointment came when we ordered two dozen oysters and our server returned to tell us they had run out. We also ordered the lobster with blackened steak  $40, BBQ shrimp appetizer $9, Crab cakes $12, fried shrimp platter $16, and three alcoholic drinks totaling $35. So it was expensive... and I was prepared for that.   I do not mind expensive prices, as long as it is worth it. The steak was very disappointing. We ordered is MEDIUM and it came back medium well. It was very dry and bland. I had to ad a whole lot of A1 sauce. I have never used A1 sauce because I've never had such a bland steak. So they lost major points for that. Also, I was not at all impressed with their BBQ shrimp appetizer. I've had much much better. And I'm obviously local so I have credibility when I say I've had better. There are way too many other places to get better BBQ shrimp to name.   It was overall okay. I probably wouldn't come back on my own, unless someone asked me to join a group. I certainly do not think the food is worth what the price is. I think it is a tourist trap since it is on Bourbon Street and tourists probably think that's real and authentic NOLA food. It kinda is, but certainly not the best. You can go to other great restaurants and pay the same price (which I won't mind) much muc better quality food. If I had to suggest something to this restaurant (as a business owner myself) I would lower the prices by 30-40%. Sell more volume and they'd probably even make more money.   I get asked a lot by tourists to recommend them a place to eat, since I have a shop in the French Quarter AND on Magazine Street, when I'm in the Quarter I have and never will recommend this place. If someone asks me how this place is, I would not recommend them at all, and evens lightly discourage it.   Not trying to be mean, just being honest.

I really appreciate that the roll was only $7.50 and the slices were not so large I felt like I needed to cut them, which isn't really possible with chop sticks.

I've been to many music venue and always feel that most are jam pack with bodies and it gets a little way too suffocated with people smoking and body heats. The Filmore had the AC full blast but not to the point of being cold. The lighting and sound was amazing. The beautiful chandelier was a good touch to the decor. When you take the escalator up to the venue inside the Masquerade, you will have to stand in line before you can pass security to enter the music venue. I love it that we didn't have to stand outdoor like most music venue to get inside. There is a few bars inside once you enter. You can purchase your drinks and also bites to much on while waiting for the concert to start. I had a fantastic concert experience to catch my all time favorite band. Regarding to one less star in my rating was because once the concert is over, you have two exit to take, Canal or casino. We took the casino exit and there was a long wait of people wanting to head to the casino but there were only one usher checking our driver license to re-enter the casino. My problem with this is that when we were heading to stand in line, they check our driver license and gave us a wristband to indicate we were old enough to drink and not to mention we had to show our ID previously to even enter Harrah's casino. It was just ridiculous and unnecessary. There were so many unhappy concert goer who were ID even when they look way too old to be carded.",Nightlife

I noticed that this location just opened up in mid city, and someone here on yelp mentioned it.  The service was alright, the ladies at the register were friendly. So was the waitress lady that brought out my food. The service was pretty speedy as well, which I liked very well.  The food was good, but not quiet as good as your standard mom and pop asian restaurant. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken with brown rice. The Kung Pao chicken was very good. It was nice and spicy and you could tell that the food was fresh. The brown rice was okay but nothing to brag about.  There were several things that I liked about this place. They do sell beer but the selection is rather limited. Like Sapporo, miller lite and Abita. They have a coca cola soda fountain that lets you chose plenty of flavor combinations for your soda. You should try strawberry sprite, its the shiznat!  They also have a lot of healthy menu options going on here.

3388,DBLBLK Cafe,29.9568341,-90.0785523,19.0,"After weeks of following the company's Instagram page and being enticed by pictures of their popular menu items, my friend and I made plans to visit the restaurant. Our first and second attempts were thwarted by day-of closures, which we were made aware of through social media. Finally, we were able to drop in on a Friday.   Getting to the place was relatively easy. The restaurant is located in the CBD between Canal and Tulane. Parking was not ideal. The parking lot was big enough but according to a sign on the door, it costs three dollars or you will get towed. However, there  was no apparent place to pay and no attendant in sight. We reluctantly parked on the street after a guy in front suggested it.  Once we were inside the music playing in the background (or more like in the foreground, given its volume) was as intimidating as the staff. Where most cafes opt for easy listening, Double Black filled the dining room with ""hood anthems"" (don't get me wrong, I love trap music but wasn't expecting it at a ""cafe""). The staff seemed to be disinterested at the notion of having new customers. They were not overly welcoming and explained their menu and ordering process in a hurry-up-you're-bother-me and  in a nearly inaudible way. Pricing is reasonable, as I ordered the Shrimp Wrap, which is under $10. I added the Style Fries and a drink bringing my bill a little under $15.   Where Double Black falls short in customer service and atmosphere they make up in the portion size and taste of their food. I dug into the fries first. They were delicious and some of the best I've had in a long time. They worked well with the sauce on top of them. It wasn't too heavily seasoned and they were just the right temperature. The same can be said for the wrap. The shrimp were a great size and cooked just right with a sweet/savory sauce in the wrap that brought it all together. The food may be worth some of the hype but the truth is, this restaurant is one of those places you might want to order your food and leave. When leaving this place you more than likely will not get a cheerful, ""Thank you. Come Back Soon."" but if the owners are basing their business on just taste alone, those niceties aren't needed...they know you'll be back.",Restaurants

Because we had been in NOLA for a couple of days when we wandered in, we noticed that the prices for things here were  higher than other places.  Not sure why!  But, this is definitely the kind of place that offers one stop shopping.  You can find virtually anything that is characteristic of New Orleans flavor.

Heavier, though IMHO the lesser of the two offered weiss brews.  Lots of room to play on the patio.  Interesting array of beer offerings.

I had the vegetarian adobo.  It was spot on. It tasted like my mom's cooking but without the pork or chicken. They instead used a textured soy. I finished up with halo halo.

It is pretty small and tends to get really packed whenever there is any kind of show. The cash bar is tucked away in a corner, making it somewhat difficult to get a drink if there is a big crowd.

But this last visit all of that changed, everything was the same for the most part ordering from a cage and STILL cash only. The food was hot, but had such a strange taste to it. The chicken had a taste of like gas, like the gas stove type of taste. the rice was okay but the pork and beef in it was SO salty. I couldnt even chew it I was getting a head ache.

It has a wide variety of items from medications, to school supplies, a variety of food, and cleaning supplies.  I always go to Rite Aid when I run out of an essential and don't want to brave Walmart or Trader Joe's.    For a small Rite Aid, this store could pass for a liquor store because they definitely stock ample varieties of beer/wine/liquor.  I guess that's the proximity to the college campuses and New Olreans uniqueness in general.     Take the extra five minutes to make a Plenti card.

I love the ""subway"" style way of choosing toppings.  I wish I could say I liked the burger more, but I just didn't.  I chose the Lamb burger on Brioche with feta, cucumber, mixed greens, green onions and garlic aioli.  The flavor combination was good, but the burger meat was dry, crumbly and a little less flavorful than I would like.  I suppose that's the steam effect.  I also wish they offered some ""specialty burger"" ideas.  The topping options are overwhelming and I feel like I could have used a guide.  Honestly, there was no way to know what some of them were without asking.  Fortunately the counter people were friendly, helpful and reassuring about my choices.  Although, I get the feeling they are not particularly foodies, but college kids who could be anywhere.    It's also a little pricy for what it is.  I paid $12 for just a burger, no side or drink.  But I will go back.  I like that it's a healthier option and that there are so many combination choices.  Next time I'll try a beef burger and creamier cheese.

Upon arriving, they escort you upstairs and give you (strong) cucumber water to sip on while you fill out some forms and wait. I was placed in another room with another woman, which was weird at first because she was clearly trying to relax and the receptionist kept talking and talking on and on to me.   The forms asked your standard questions about basic info, allergies, etc but then there were the weird ones that I didn't feel they needed to know for a massage - but I told myself, maybe the forms were standard for all services to keep it simple for them.   I *think* my lady's name was Michelle - don't hold me to that though. We moved to the room where she told me to change and lie on the warm bed and get situated. She began on the front then worked her to my back and then my scalp - which I didn't know was included and was rather intense. The hot towel wrap was a nice addition to her completing her services, however.  Now - there was a question on the form asking if I (or anyone filling out the form for that matter) bruised easily - kind of an odd question but I said no because to my knowledge - no, I don't just bruise randomly.   But then... two days later, I woke up and notice what I didn't initially think was a bruise all over the front of shoulder, was a huge bruise... it stuck around for about 4 days following my massage and just wasn't a cute look. I know Michelle said I was the tensest she had seen in months BUT I didn't think that meant she pushed on my muscles so hard I would bruise! Ouch!

I called China Wall back in vain (I knew they were going to be douchebags about it, its China Wall) and the lady proceeded to tell me she sells ""so much of that dish everyday"" and ""I just don't know what I like"" and insisted I return this literally entirely full foul container of disgusting noodles to the restaurant to get my money back.

We were sat and the waitress actually seemed very nice and attentive at first. But then she didn't give us napkins. Or straws. Or silverware. Our food was placed infront of us by not our waiter and I asked that person for silverware (seems logical since food was just placed in front of me) She said okay and ran off. So then I didn't ask anyone else for it (don't want to seem rude- I trusted she would eventually come). After 5 min of my food getting cold I finally flagged down our waiter (who really didn't seem to care that she had only been to our table to take our order) and she took about another 5 min to get the silverware. Come on people. You have 1 job. Then I notice that what my dad ordered isn't what was put infront of him. They sent it back and got him the right thing. By the time he got his correct food- we were finished ours. Then to top it off they put the wrong order onto our bill. Luckily my dad checked but seriously the waiter still had only been to our table that 1 time to get our orders (and the brief set down of our silverware). This is crap service and the fact that my dad gave her 20% tip because of their retarded electronic tabletop cashier thingy is heartbreaking.

I don't even have pierced ears for damnssakes!  But still...I was walking along Royal with a dear girlfriend who is admittedly much girlier than I (bless her heart ;-P), and I think she's ready to be mawwied...or least have a ring, heehee. So she looks at me, and says, ""C'mon! Let's go in and just take a look.""    And sure enough, I find that I do have that irrational voice in my head that says, ""Oooooh, pretty sparkly things.""

In my opinion, this is the worst Wendy's to go to. The person ringing up the food always has an attitude or seems like they don't want to be there. We all know how that goes.

2131,Toast,29.9185016,-90.1164893,16.0,"I had the pleasure recently of having breakfast at Toast Uptown.  Toast is located on Laurel Street at the old Laurel Street bakery location.  Toast is less than a year old, and word has is definitely out on how good it is.  I knew to arrive early, or I'd have a wait in front of me.  We arrived at 9:30 and immediately found 2 seats at the bar.  The regular tables were all full, one with a party of 12 (tables pushed together).  None of the tables outside were occupied because it was still a little chilly outside.  The atmosphere at Toast is bright and cheerful, albeit small.  You're in pretty close quarters with everyone around you, but I'm fine with that.  My only complaint was that it was VERY LOUD.  They've put foam under the chairs and tables, but it didn't seem to be helping much.  Once the large party left, it got considerably better.  I find the prices at Toast to be extremely reasonable for what you get, with entrees ranging from $10-$14, and smaller side items (like toast topped with prosciutto, honey, and ricotta, or an order of ableskivers) going for $5-$8.    For my entrée, I had the croque madame.  It was huge and delicious, and was served with a light side salad.  My BF had the hangar steak topped with tarragon aioli, served with roasted potatoes and sunny side up eggs.  His meal was also fantastic.  I was really dying to try some of the ableskivers with lemon curd dip, but their portions are huge and there was just no way.    By the time we left 45 minutes later, there were 15 people outside waiting, and all outside tables were full.

I ordered a beer from the menu and both the server and the manager came to ask me twice what beer I wanted before they finally put in the order. The wait for most of the night was very long for a drink, and the place was never full. However, they started turning people away because they said the fire marshal was restricting how many people could be there. In fact, two in our party were trying to go downstairs to smoke, as they could not smoke on the balcony, and were told that if they left they wouldn't be able to come back, even though they had an open bar tab.

Cornbread was extra at 75 cents. Everything was delicious except the fried oysters. The batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish. The oyster was more battered versus breaded. If the batter for the oysters was the same as the catfish, they probably would have tasted great.

647,Charcoal's Gourmet Burger Bar,29.9293678863,-90.0768316473,18.0,"Charcoal's has only been open for about a week but they seem to be settling in okay other than their product ordering - they were out of bison, turkey, and veggie burgers (clearly the 3 most popular other than regular beef) as well as cheddar cheese.  I would think the popularity of those 4 items should have been pretty easy to predict but then again I'm sure I would have made other mistakes.  In terms of the burgers, they're pretty good.  I ended up with a venison burger on my first visit cooked medium rare and it was just about right - and the key is that it was still juicy which of course will often be an issue with lean game meats.  The brioche bun was very good and other than the burger being over-seasoned it was medium thickness, seemed to be good quality meat, and tasted pretty good.  Of course, it was $0.25 each to add lettuce and tomato then another $1.00 to add avocado then another $2.00 to upgrade from chips to onion rings then with a drink added the total bill came to almost $16.  For one person.  I mean, it was a pretty good burger and the homemade onion rings were nice but I could have gone to Wendy's for half the price and gotten a burger that satisfied similarly.  Charcoal's actually makes Tru Burger look cheap which isn't easy and it almost makes The Company Burger appear under-salted which also ain't easy.  I still haven't had a great burger in NOLA - give me Michael Symon's burgers any day from B Spot and Bar Symon.  I've also had much better burgers in my previous residences of Portland and Chicago - and they cost less even at sit-down restaurants.  For these prices I want the best and I'd prefer if Charcoal's had a menu of 5-10 great combinations rather than making customers choose all the ingredients for every burger served.  Certainly, I may stop by Charcoal's occasionally but I don't expect it to be a habit.  Wow, it's now an hour after I ate my burger and I can still taste the salt on my tongue...",Restaurants
3447,12 Bar On Fulton Street,29.9465281,-90.0653033,5.0,"This is a great bar for private events and live music.  The place is split into two long and narrow rooms with one half being the main bar area that has a cool ceiling shaped like a guitar and the other room being the stage area for viewing music.  I'm friends with the owners of this place and they generally keep things running pretty well here.  The main thing that gives me the ""blues"" about this juke joint is that some of the bartenders here are sometimes not my favorite as they seem unable to handle large crowds well and can be painfully slow while they also have some other bartenders that just seem to always be slow.  If it wasn't for the inconsistent to occasionally poor service this would be a four start joint.  They are still a pretty new establishment so they are still breaking in the staff so with time I would expect the service to improve.    I would come here more often except for its location, as I don't hang out in the Warehouse District that much, and parking is never easy in the area.  If you're looking to book a private party or event this is certainly a nice venue to check out.  As far as just hanging out here as a bar it is usually more fun on nights when they have a good band and they generally keep a pretty full music schedule.  One area where this bar seems to really excel is that they probably have some of the best and most spacious bathrooms I've ever seen in the area bars so that should be good news for all the ladies.",Nightlife

What I'm learning about cigar bars is you have three kinds- the cigar shops that allow you to smoke in a small area that's secondary to their purpose, the high end cigar bar that is more of a jacket and dress up type place to sip wine and enjoy a puff, and the casual lounge style cigar bar where you can play darts or pool and it's a much more relaxed atmosphere.  Dos Jefes is the latter - a low key lounge with a large bar area where you can listen to live music, a back area with a pool table, slot machines, and an outdoor area as well.   You can make an evening out of this bar or just stay until you finish your cigar.

But really?! $10?! I rather have a jukebox! $10 can get you over 20+ songs of great music by professional artists...yeah I know it's the performance, but they weren't that good!)   Anyways, it was fun. They had the barber chair where you can pay I think $5-7 to get motorboat from the girl and get fireball poured into your mouth for less than 2 minutes.

Instead of ordering a bajillion different orders, we had already pre-planned getting the sampler platter for meatheads, and falafel sandwiches for the veggies amongst us.  Let me just tell you, everything was fresh and scrumptious! I'm dying for a place like this in Columbus!  The platters were monstrous and had every fresh meat imaginable.

They are bigger in size of the ones I get in NYC and double the price ($6) but I can imagine the cost is a factor of limited demand (small lines) and pallets in NOLA for a gyro vs a po boy.

The rotisserie dishes were richly flavored and succulent. They were served with a gratin dauphinois that was soft and comforting, and a small green salad lightly dressed to bring some brightness and acidity. The soft shell crab was crispy and perfect. The appetizers were elegant and carefully curated. Service was impeccable and the sommelier, Bruno, recommended 2 bottles for the table, both from Bordeaux (per our request) that were both reasonably priced and perfectly paired to our dishes. We didn't opt for dessert because of a time-sensitive commitment, but we will be back. It was amazing, and Chef Dominique and Jon, the owner, both came out to speak with us twice.

I turned my vehicle around and decided to investigate this new business. I pulled in to the parking lot and checked it out. Sure enough my eyes did not deceive me there was a new business sign in front of the place. Making extra sure of the new changes I went inside.  The first new change I noticed was the bartender. A very pretty red head who had an incredibly positive disposition. I spoke with her about her business. She informed me of the new changes, Namely the change in management which I was very ecstatic about.  The next changes she informed me about were the menu. I took a look and placed an order. I ordered their signature ""Recovery Room"" burger. It is a mixture of beef and hot sausage which gives it an extra kick. I made sure my burger was dressed with all the fixin's and topped with pepper jack cheese which gave it a little extra spice! I substituted their fries for some onion rings. The burger was fantastic, and it was so big that I actually could not finish it. The onion rings were good too, they were nice and crispy just the way I like it. They also came with some spicy dipping sauce. My hats off to the blonde lady in the kitchen, she did a good job cooking my meal.  This is the 4th bar and grill that has been here in this very location. I don't know if some Voodoo witch doctor put a curse on this location but the last 3 businesses had some bad luck here. I told the bartender the same thing that I told the last 2 business owners,""You got a good thing going here don't screw it up"". I just hope she listens to my advice because I would really hate to see these guys go out of business. Still this place is a work in progress and I will be stopping buy every once in a while to see how things are going.  This place has a full bar and quiet a variety of beers .

The previous day I had dropped in and questioned a server about their vegan pizza options, which the restaurant was promoting on its sidewalk sandwich board. The server was friendly and enthusiastic. She indicated that one of our options would be to build our own pizza.  When we arrived and were seated, we were met by a surly server who gave every indication of not wanting to be there. We should have left, but we persisted. He told us the build your own option was not available and he was impatient when we asked for modifications to the single vegan pizza (""Hail Seitan"") offering on the menu. His service became increasingly hostile.  The pizza that we were served was dull and bland. It had very few toppings except potato chips, which did not work well on the pizza. There was so little vegan cheese on the pizza, it was hard to detect the flavour. Never have we seen a restaurant so badly mess up their primary menu item as this restaurant did.  New Orleans does not appear to have a lot of vegan restaurants, but many mainstream restaurants seem to try to accommodate vegans. This attempt at accommodating vegans was desultory and ill-mannered.

This was the case with both mine and manfriend's steak and gouda ""panini"" on our recent visit.  If it had been warm throughout, it probably would have been a decent sandwich.  The salads seem much more promising, though unfortunately I have yet to order one.  They are made fresh to order by an employee at the bar and they have several menu options or a ""create your own"" from the typical salad bar fixings . There are Sucre pre-made desserts and fresh scooped gelato available, as well.  They actually serve beer out of vending machines which require tokens that are purchased at the counter.

There's some hope for the dish. Maybe they could make it with fresh fries. MAYBE they could go buy (or make) some garlic oil to douse the old fries in and revive them a bit.

There is an upstairs area that gets a little more risque depending on the night. I have seen full male nudity up there and people get handsy. No photography upstairs or you'll be shown the door.

A group of around 8 people came here for breakfast and were given quite possibly the worst service any of us have ever experienced. There were maybe 6 other guests in entire the place.  I don't think there was a manager on duty, which may have been the root of the problem.  Either way, we were treated as if we were an imposition.    Our ice waters came one at a time.  Literally, one at a time.  Then when we ordered cocktails (from a completely different server), we were told they were out of the following (not told upfront, but AS we ordered the items, we were informed they were out) - Champagne All juices Ketel One Grey Goose  And finally, they were out of croissants.   After waiting 35 min for drinks, I finally went to the bar and stood there while the server poured the beers, then I served them to the table myself.   20 minutes later, the food was served cold and incorrect, but yes, the pancakes are big.

It was quiet in here, not even a radio playing, but you could smell the aromas coming from the kitchen. I ordered an 8pc wings with fries and a large drink which totalled just $10.55 after tax, not bad. The ordering process was standard, just place it at the counter. You can also call ahead and have it ready for pickup.  Wings came out piping hot, they were also huge pieces. I made 2 1/4 meals out of that one plate. I would say it's the Manchu of Mid City.

Everything I've had has been delicious even the way they prepare their eggs are great. Their Red Beans and rice are homemade and are my favorite dish that they serve. You can tell they cook those beans 5ish hours because they are so tender and flavorful that I really don't need any sausage with them even though they do give you enough sausage with it. You can get a smaller portion of the Red Beans and Rice as a side dish with their CatFish Platter, Seafood Platter and the BBQ Shrimp meal.

I brought it in and he fixed me up with a new rear tire and rebuilt my rack for a very decent price. I also really appreciated him cleaning up the frame itself, because when I brought it in it looked like it had been dragged through the mud. I was kind of embarrassed but he didn't seem to mind too much.   Yesterday I stopped by again right before a job interview because it was raining and I suddenly realized the necessity of fenders. I walked in sopping wet with a mud streak up my butt and he told me to come back in just half an hour and he'd have them installed. I grabbed a cuppa and when I returned my bike looked smashing! Parts and service were extremely reasonable, and I appreciated him taking pity on my situation and turning it around so quickly.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern.   The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need.   Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well.   Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken.   All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets.   We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch.

There is something for everyone on the menu with vegetarian, vegan, and meat options, plus a specials menu with incredible seasonal sides and special meals.  Two things I really appreciated were:  prices were right on all around with great portion sizes (you know how pretentious some places can get when the food is good and the prices are like 'whoa now,' not here); and the employees top down were genuinely welcoming, friendly, and seemed to love their job.

So 4 not 5 because the noise level, dessert was good not great and 5 minutes after we were finshished dessert and drinks we had to ask for the check. Service was great but not excellent.

Well poured drinks at reasonable prices and a chill clientele make for a great bar to hang out in. Sadly, I have complaints.  First off some people bring in their killer dogs and let them just roam around and personally this makes me very uncomfortable.  Last time I was there two huge unleashed dogs blocked the way to the bathroom so I had to go outside and around to another door in order to get to the bathroom!!  Leave your giant dogs at home. Who thinks their dog wants to spend hours in a bar?  I have even seen them there during Saints games when the bar is packed.  It's just stupid! Next I have to rant about the new owner.  He exemplifies the word douche.  Every time i have seen him in his bar he is trashed!  He is not a fun friendly drunk he is down right belligerent!  I have seen him yell at the bartenders in front of a crowded bar.  He makes no attempt to meet the patrons of the bar which I think is bad business.  There was a time he was so obnoxious my girlfriends and I actually left to get away from him. Minus those factors it's a great place to meet your friends for drinks!",Nightlife

2859,Republic NOLA,29.9440505,-90.0657171,5.0,"It's really hard to judge a music venue objectively, because almost undoubtedly the quality of the performance will influence your view of the space.  After experience an amazing show by Stars along with their ridiculously fun opening act Geographer, I was tempted to just give a blanket 5 stars to Republic just for booking them.  I was finally able to put on my objective glasses though.  THE GOOD  Intimacy:  What do I mean by that?  Well for anyone who hasn't seen a show at Republic yet, it's basically two floors with the second floor being a balcony that overlooks the main floor ""atrium"" area.  This atrium area is TINY, and by my best estimation could fit at most 200 people even when everyone is crammed together.  The benefit of this is that if you can secure a ticket to your particular show, it makes the entire experience really intimate even when the band is rocking out.  The people in the balcony are literally on top of the band, and even the people at the back of the atrium are only about 10-15 rows of people back from the stage.  It almost lends a, dare I say, element of exclusivity to all the shows there.  THE BAD  Acoustics:  So here's the problem.  Since it's such a small space, the main speakers have to be placed at awkward positions.  At least 4 of them hang directly above the first 3 rows of fans, and there are some poor souls in the balcony areas who are actually standing BEHIND the speakers.  I guess they get to enjoy their music experience via sound bounce-back from the walls.  You don't notice the bad acoustics as much when the bands play softer songs, but when they start to get amped up and play loud it sounds almost cacophonic.  What's worse, at the loudest levels you can barely hear the actual singing.  Bad acoustics, bad sound-checking.   PURGATORY  Not much to see here.  Moving on.

On the Other Hand, located in the Carrolton Neighborhood, was the most overwhelming of the stores; it is CHOCK-FULL of merchandise.  The sales person who assisted me was very solicitous and helped me figure out the dressing room situation.  Seriously the store is going to explode from stock.  This store probably had the greatest number of formal gowns, but some of them seemed to date from 1984; so if I was drag queen, it would have been perfect.  The prices were very reasonable but I think I was losing my urge to rummage.  I also think they carry men's clothes so that also makes them unique.",Shopping

The aforementioned docent rushes over and tells me not to take photos please (I  completely fine with this, their gallery, their rules.) But then she went on about how there are signs *everywhere* throughout the gallery and cameras everywhere (as if she thought I might abscond with a Takashi?!). I only saw one on photography sign when I got further into the gallery space. in any event, my partner and I roamed about the gallery a bit more, and I stopped to examine another piece by an artist that is very dear to me. The docent came up to ask if I ""knew anything"" about the work, and I replied pretty pleasantly that I loved the artist and had read about his work. She at that point said something like ""well then I guess you know everything you need to know about it""...I was not saying I was an expert, just that I was familiar with it. The thing that really rankled me about this interaction however was when I conversed with her a bit with my partner, she asked where we were coming from, and I said we were in town for a medical conference and that my partner (who was dressed in a logo T shirt) was attending as a surgeon in training.

If you see me in anything other gym clothes, a suit or pajamas, chances are I'm wearing that belt. Finally, after 15 years of continuous wear, the belt started to come apart.  The leather on the back was all warped and stretched out and was separating from the alligator skin.  The holes were all stretched out from me getting fatter as I got older.  The loop had fallen off.  I took it to Bayou Belts to see if it could be repaired.  The owner told me that he could take it apart, clip the leather and reshape it, fix the loop and clean it but it wouldn't be perfect because there was so much wear on it.  He also said it would be fairly expensive.  I'm looking around at his store and he's got belts starting at about $500, so I'm thinking I'd be willing to spend about $150 to get this one decent looking.  He calculates the cost and it's like $25.  Of course I tell him to go ahead with the repair.  A few days later he calls me up to let me know that it's finished.  I'm not expecting that much, not for $25.  I get there and the belt looks almost brand new.  It feels and smells brand new.  The alligator skin is polished and looking great!

The spring rolls were fried in stale old oil and had a rancid odor.  The summer rolls were bland and barely edible. The tuna tartare was the only appetizer that was palatable. The duck confit is served on a spongy steamed bun that is sticky and weird. The service was fair. We had a very green waitress that did not know much about the menu.

A super nice man greeted us and told us we were in the right place - just needed to head upstairs. I must say - the exterior does neither Feelings nor Sentiments any justice (Yelpers are right - what names!!?!*!). Very cool - both places. Kind of French country meets shabby chic.  We kept wondering where the heck a balcony would be as we trekked up this dark staircase, but voila! It's all interior magic -- narrow walkway with cute little 2-top tables along the railing - looking down into Feelings courtyard. Music seranades yiu as you hear the relaxing sounds of Feelings' fountain. One of the co-owners greeted us - hooked us up with a pretty good Nappa cab -- which was made instantly fantastic by the introduction of a fabulous cheese plate! We chose the 3-cheese option and let the expert do the choosing. He and his co-owner wife had lived in Nice, and some of that magic came back with them. He asked what we didnt like, what we preferred - and ohlala - the choices and accoutrements were fanbloodytastic...a pungent cows milk cheese wrapped in spruce and washed in local beer; a garlicky cows milk - very softy and creamy; and an aged Gouda (husband and i buy this regularly - yum!!). Candied pecans, sugared walnuts, cornichons, and Castellanos (?? the bright green ones) olives came alongside - and some scrumptious, perfectly-cooked fresh french bread. Heaven!!!! So relaxing. SO charming. Husband-wife duo apparently also teach French lessons along with a wine tasting. What a combo! This place is a total diamond find. Will definitely be back. Merci bien!!

When confronted, she said its a simple error but they cost the same. In reality Subway does not  have a code to charge extra for pickles! I did not get the extra cheese on my sandwich that I paid for. Not only this, this location has terrible staff and service. After paying I asked for a cup for water with my sandwich, the lady smirked at me and said ""we only have bottles water for you to purchase!

My wife, couple friends and I came here for her birthday, and it started poorly when we had to wait to be greeted by the hostess. You need to have someone tethered to the hostess station. It is really bad business to have people waiting for a table at a less than full restaurant. After a round of drinks we ordered and proceeded to wait nearly an hour for the food to come out of the kitchen. I'm not unsympathetic to servers, but you at least have to acknowledge to your customers when you're not living up to expectations. The band on stage made the wait a little more bearable, but the meal was subsequently rushed, as we had after dinner plans. Additionally, for the quantity and quality of the food, they're overreaching on their pricing.

One thing that did caught my eye was a lithograph that the artist made for the local band Bonnerama. They are a really good band and I was surprised that they were selling something like that to tourist. I find out that the artist is friends with the band member and they did their album cover for them. That's pretty cool but it didn't persuade me to buy anything.   But my mother did buy some some lithographs...or maybe they were postcards. Anyway, she really liked the pictures with the different smiling cats as they looked like the one from Alice in Wonderland.

I reserve this for my last-ditch alcohol efforts, after I comb through Rouses and Williams for my fancy-pants bottles of quality booze.   To wit: I had a limited Christmas budget, but I didn't want my gifts to look cheap to the untrained eye. Off to Martin's we go! I looked confused, and a staffer stepped up within seconds. Whoohoo! I had $25 in my pocket to make my brother think he was getting a ""very ritzy"" Christmas gift, and the staffer understood. He pointed to several bottles with good pedigree that fit my budget, explaining the relative merits of each in a nutshell. I had his full attention, and he managed to solve my problem in less than 3 minutes. Quality of help trumps quantity.   But it's not just about Christmas gifts and ritzy bottles. I've lugged home several bottles of wine that cost less than $10 and brought the thunder. (Miss you, Gary V.) Each display was marked with reviews and helpful signs, letting me know that the staff had tasted and approved. Martin's just doesn't specialize in blank looks and confessions that they only drink vodka. If a staffer doesn't know about the wine or beer you are looking at, they can point to the person who does.   Did I mention beer? Martin's has beer. They have lots of weird beers, wild beers, unique beers, far-flung beers. They sell by the bottle, with mixy-sixies available as well. Their super chiller (marked for wine) will also make your beer frosty in the time it takes to do a lap around the store so you can walk down Magazine Street with a tasty brew in-hand.   I have not mentioned cheese, but I will. Martin's has fancy cheese. If you buy all of it, I will be grumpy because runny cheese is my secret lover. Do I need to sell anyone on the merits of good cheese? No, didn't think so. If you want the cheese, turn right upon entry.   So Martin's = wine. Martin's = beer. Martin's = cheese.

Each dish ranged from $10-12 and came with two per order. My favorite was the tempura shrimp. It was fried well and had the most flavor. The steak was dry and not tender at all and they gave a lot of it. The mushroom taco was deconstructed and you have to put it together yourself. The drum was also dry and flavorless. A little hot sauce could have made each of these dishes a little better.   Octopus botanos - came with potatoes and poblano rice. Large pieces of octopus, rice was tasty.   Cauliflower app w/ salsa seca - roasted cauliflower, had good crunch to it. Salsa was creamy and just okay, not enough flavor. Not something I would order again.

The flour ones used for burritos are squishy, damp and stretchy. Almost raw. First time we ate here the tortilla was actually cold. For tacos, I asked for crunchy for fear their soft would be like the burrito tortilla. Sadly, the crunchy tortilla was exactly like Mission brand boxed that you get at the supermarket.       The cheese option is weird too. They offer a sandwich slice of white cheese. I refused it, so I don't know if it's mozzarella or what.      Where they earn their stars is the other fillings. Many meat options. All fish options are fried unfortunately. Lots of options for beans, cilantro onion salad, pico de gallo and several fresh salsas.      Also, a full bar and they did ok with making a Bloody Maria.      The inside of the restaurant is attractive and comfortable, much more than a taco shop.

If they don't carry an item, they can still have an informative conversation about it with you.  Should you order an item from the website and want to return it, you can return it at the showroom even if they don't officially carry the item.  This is much easier than mailing it back, and I don't have to pay shipping.  I have had many enjoyable conversations with the employees about product, fitness, and anything really.

While it may be a medley of all of those things, the menu does an excellent job at titillating your taste buds on a voyage of sweet, savory, spice and everything nice. Each cocktail was uniquely crafted to arouse and enhance their flavorful dishes. A push cart makes its way around the restaurant providing an inducement to add supplementary flavors to your table as the meal progresses. The inside has been beautifully remastered to the tune of a trendy jungle cocktail party.

Instead of having a light tan, hard, crackly, crispy, exterior, this bread was deep brown and soft. It was almost exactly like the Pepperidge Farm sub sandwich rolls that I get at the grocery except these were a different shape. The inside didn't have the ""bubbles"" that are usually present in French bread - it was ""cottony,"" like a bun.   Perhaps Dong Phuong now offers a bun to their commercial customers, in addition to their banh mi bread? NOLA Grocery did say bun.  But If the sandwiches are going to be advertised as ""po-boys,"" then a certain type of bread must be used. If not, just call them ""subs.""

I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,  We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything.

Two weeks ago, my wife and I both ate Lux's burgers (I had the Lucy cheeseburger while she ate the Lux cheeseburger, with bacon and egg), and we were absolutely blown away by the service; fresh, hand-formed patties, and grilled to absolute perfection (bit of char, juicy inside, totally delicious) burgers; comfortable, attractive surroundings; just-right wait time for the cook to work his magic; and priced affordably in an ordinarily expensive tourist town. Today's return visit confirmed our first experience. I repeated the Lucy burger, while my wife tried their Philly Cheesesteak (shaved ribeye, and the owner suggested that she add a little steak sauce--WOW!). Once again, my cheeseburger was stellar. Oh! I forgot to mention earlier that the fresh toppings of shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles, sauce, and two slices of cheese only added to the culinary experience of consuming our new definition of ""Best New Orleans Burger.""

Then we had the oysters Rockefeller which, honestly, I found inedible. Though I will say, the large size of the dish is really unbelievable for the price you pay ($10). The oysters were gigantic (I'm sure some people will love this, but I found them to be pretty gross) with some green purée on top of them which had both an unpleasant taste and texture.

Usually if you ask them the price, Jacques (I think the manager, or at least the guy who does all the pricing), will look at it, cut it to half the given price, and then say, ""But I'll give it to you for half that."" My friends got a couch for $100 marked $300, and I bought an antique mirror for $20, that was originally marked $80.

The first thing I noticed was the politeness of the staff. Even though Koz's is your typical po-boy and hot plate lunch/dinner menu it's always nice when your a first timer to be walked through it and have some of the more popular customer selections pointed out to you. Everything looked and sounded delicious and I was really intrigued by the ability to order a po-boy in either 8"", 12"", whole loaf, or 4"" toast (really like the idea of whole loaf for game day parties next Saints season). The salad selections on the menu are enough in my opinion to satisfy light eaters and vegetarians alike and the hot plate lunches and dinners include red beans and rice all the way down to seafood plates. Koz's also a decent amount of side items and daily specials to choose from.   After a few minutes of looking things over my girlfriend and I decided to bypass the po-boys this time around and each order a seafood plate that comes with two sides. I went with the fried oyster plate with the vegetable of the day (green beans) and a side salad and she went with the fried shrimp plate with baked macaroni and onion rings. Everything came out hot and fresh and in a timely manner. The oysters and shrimp were a very nice size and my girlfriend said that the baked macaroni was killer (which was obvious since it was gone in no time from her plate).   All in all when you consider the quality of the food and service we received and the affordability of our meal I would say that our first trip to Koz's was a success. We will definitely be coming back to have lunch or dinner and try out one of the po-boys on the menu.",Restaurants

The wine list was among the worst I've ever encountered, with only the most expensive (and overpriced) selections.  Not a single moderately priced and good quality bottle of wine on the list. Not everyone wants to spend $200+ on a bottle of wine, but those wines dominate the list. The restaurant seating is one large room with nothing to block the noise, which was substantial.

194,Magazine Antique Mall,29.9248982,-90.0851834,19.0,"I really don't bother with negative reviews, but this time an exception has to be made.  I'd like to follow up on Elsa H.'s review of this place, since I was a member of the family being threatened with police action over trying to purchase a lamp.  I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel), and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously, it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff, noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter, etc.  I continued to visit, however, because there's a certain sort of eclectic ""junk pile"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time, the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us, however.  One detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner, the husband (?), rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something, immediately not only made the ""tell the police to hurry up"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire, and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me, in a different area of the store, and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere, that's a little hard to digest.  I'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.  If you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques, I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local, I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move, we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally, if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store, I encourage you to first be an observant ""customer"", and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all, given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices.   Please don't support this horrible store.  And in summary, it's unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow zero-star reviews.",Shopping

Good omen, number three: Chef Aaron Burgau came walking to of the kitchen while we were at the bar (the cab driver was faster than I had anticipated), and said, ""What are you guys doing here?""

LMATTES: As for the mattes themselves, they are lovely, but stainy( which I guess is nothing new for a liquid matte). My first application of Kitten was a little messy, especially as I cleaned my lip line up( but that's probably because this is my first time applying liquid matte).   Nonetheless, I love it! I've gotten SO many compliments on both Kitten and Sista Girl! They're beautiful, vibrant shades and I'm so happy to be supporting a Black owned company!   Two things though:   1.

We started with the oysters good enough, which were four fried oysters with bearnaise sauce and Benton's bacon- a must get. Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash purée and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish. The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde.

It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.     The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!     Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.    Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!

620,Maïs Arepas,29.9418983,-90.0750378,3.0,"Okay let start by saying that ""for New Orleans"", there's no other place like it. It's Colombian. Not Mexican. (Which sways towards cheesy and TexMex) This place is what you'll find in Miami, New York, DF or Cartagena. The decor is chic yet earthy. I can even go as far as saying that I see a reflection of myself in the ambiance. Now let's talk about the food. I'm not one to give a great assessment on what Colombian should be but I liked it a lot. I had the arepa sampler and the chorizo arepa- both which I devoured. Each arepa had its distinct taste and I wanted more. My only drawback of the whole ordeal was that I so know arepa to Colombians, as is what hot dogs are to Americans, or tacos to Mexicans. For an appetizer and one arepa I paid $30(tip not included) and to me, that's ""fine dining"" prices. The rock in my shoe was that those plaintain chips served as a side item to the arepa, were unmistakably ""Zambos plaintain chips""(cheap Honduran bag plaintain chips). I don't have a problem eating them but for $13 an arepa I'm definitely being ripped off. Please slice and fry me a real plaintain chips, don't cop-out with the cheap stuff! That arepa plate served as is should be no more than $9-$10. It wasn't filling at all-for Colombian street food this place is a little steep. If another place opens up that serves the same with lower prices, you guys are gone-pecan. Other than that, this place is solid. If you're thinking about going, please try it out.

383,Goodwill,29.9643494,-90.1003074,19.0,"I call this Goodwill the ""trashy thrift store down the street"". No offense to the employees here (who are all very nice, by the way), but everything about this particular Goodwill makes me feel really cheap and used like a dirty condom from Family Dollar. The building itself is incredibly large, and next door is some sort of program for people who have EBT and don't have any clue in the universe how to apply for a job. Most of the clothes are women's, but that's alright because I occasionally wear women's pants. All of the clothes are extremely trashy looking, like the kind you find in a dumpster during a dangerous stroll through the St. Roch neighborhood (because we all do that for fun). I once found a lovely pair of women's burgundy wine corduroy pants that fit me like a prince and only payed $3 for them. I suppose that is the point of Goodwill. It's trashy, but if you are lucky enough to find something good, it's going to be incredibly cheap.   I typically like rummaging through the LP section at thrift stores because this is where I find piles of classical and opera records for 50 cents a piece. However at this Goodwill, all of the records are either missing from their sleeve, scratched like an ex-girlfriend would your car, or broken. I also make a habit out of finding lost gems within the piles of books, but this Goodwill has a terrible selection of books that only your grandmother would read. The book area is huge, but yeah, don't get too excited.   In order to find the true gems when thrift store shopping, you really have to know HOW to thrift store shop. I've found the occasional bookcase for $10, but you have to peak your head in every other week or so to check on the new arrivals. I live walking distance from this Goodwill, so I do just that. Every blue moon I'll spot a dainty looking vintage chair, refurnished and incredibly affordable. Also, the glassware section may perhaps be the best part of this particular Goodwill. One may find a set of handsome vintage glassware on a good day. I always patrol the thrift stores for old absinthe glasses that they don't know are absinthe glasses, and sometimes run across lovely sets of vintage wine glasses, cocktail glasses, and glass cups. So take it from a professional thrift store shopper: this isn't the place for a new wardrobe, but you're sure to find the occasional gem in the furniture area or the glassware section if it's your lucky day.",Shopping

K and I were hungry and it was getting late, so I was trying to find a place that was open late. I searched for ""dinner"" in the Yelp search box and selected a couple of neighborhoods. I was scrolling down quickly and saw that La Crepe Nanou was going to be open till 11 p.m. This was the winner.  We parked not far from the place and walked over. It was a beautiful night. There was a cat lazily lounging about on the host's table/podium thing right by the door. There was a couple waiting before us when we walked up, but we were all seated promptly.  K's allergic to shellfish so that ruled a lot of menu items out for us, but we still managed to enjoy an awesome dinner. We shared the Crepe au Poulet to start with. We got some Pinot Gris to go with it. Our server warned us that the Pinot Gris was a little sweet. It was really sweet, but I (and K, too) like my alcohol sweet, so it worked out for us. The best part of the Crepe au Poulet was the Ratatouille, which we got on the side (I don't know how it normally comes). I just wanted to sit with a big bowl of that Ratatouille by a fireplace. It felt like home, because it reminded me of my host mom in Paris, who used to make us a big pot of Ratatouille about once a week.  Then I had the Duck (special) and K had the veal with tomato sauce. Honestly by this time I was getting really full, so I only had a little bit of my duck, which was really good. But I'm not good at the whole fork-and-knife thing when bones are involved (my French host parents used to tell me to just use my hands when I'd struggle at the table), so I gladly took most of it in a to-go box so I can go home and pick up the meat with my hands. The grilled veggies that it came with were also very good. K enjoyed his veal, as was witnessed by his clean plate.  We didn't have room for dessert, which was a shame because I really want to try the crepe with the Creme de Marrons.  I'm definitely gonna have to go back to try the mussels and the Crepe Marrons.

They were all crafted with a lot of thought, tons of flavor, and precision in the plating.  The last dish was New Zealand king salmon, which came in fresh that day.  All of the fish was super fresh.  The portions were VERY SMALL- more like a tasting.  He was still hungry afterwards.  I got the dumplings, which were very delicious and also the ""monkey"" salmon dish.

Food: We tried the red beans and rice and it was the best we've ever had- extremely flavorful and just the right amount of heat. (And at only $4 a bowl, a ridiculous value!) I only wish I'd been hungrier so I could have tried more of the menu. They also had heartier plates for around $15-20 like pulled pork sandwich or ribs.  Okay, service: we had GREAT service and I really liked our waitress by the time we were finished but ... when she first approached our table, I wondered if she was a bold pan handler coming inside the restaurant to ask for money. She came directly up to our table from the sidewalk (maybe she'd been on a break outside?), and didn't smile or introduce herself. She pointed to the menu and asked what we wanted. We went with it and told her. Once she had our order, she was really attentive and good to us, replacing drinks quickly, checking in about the food.

It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter.

But this makes it easy for the fashion clueless like myself, I can come in with a photo of my outfit, and get all of the needed accessories at one stop.

First time in I always order a burger, because if that is right then the next time I order something different because that will more than likely be done right too!  My burger was EXCELLENT and the tomato was absolutely awesome!  While the French toast was flavorful, it was a little soggy for my tastes, but my daughter liked it.

I am a native NYer and when I asked them if they had any white coney's they said sadly no, they did not, as they were from Detroit and white coney's are only from NY.

Why? Because the crawfish aren't as SALTY as they are at BF, and because the lady who runs the operation at Captain Sal's is ADORABLE and always fishes out the biggest crawfish in the batch to toss into the bag for me. You don't always want to eat the biggest crawfish (good way to break a fingernail, y'all), but the sentiment is nice. :-)  I just realized this review reads as though Brittney Spears had a vocabulary lesson: ""You taste like paaaradise, and I need a vacation tonight!

Then the bartender starting luring Duncan in with treats while the vodka starting luring me.  I had a drink while my dog napped on the floor and got at least 5 treats out of the deal. The bartender, dressed in a purple LSU shirt, red bandanna around his neck, red Chucks and red Sally Jesse Raphael style glasses entertained everyone with his sarcasm, but even asked if there was anything in my shopping bags I would like to put in the frig while I had my drink (so sweet!). I stayed and watch the NBA game discussing basketball with the Celtics fan sitting next to me. Everyone was so friendly, I seriously talked to almost every person in there! The place was a riot, honestly I would've stayed for hours if I didnt have to walk all the way home! On the way out the bartender asked me if I was returning for their crawfish boil on Saturdays during Jazz Fest, I told him that I couldnt make it the first Saturday, but I would try to come in Friday later, he cuts me off with ""Hey, I'm not taking damn notes, we'll see you next time"" ahahahahah! I will SO return here! It was a blast!

We then remembered seeing the place on FoodNetwork's 'Diners Drive-In and Dives'.  My oh my, they weren't kidding when they named it ""America's Best Fried Chicken""!  I had the Fried Chicken Salad and Homemade Lemonade.....BEST FC indeed! Of course it was boneless in the salad, it had a soft as butter feel when bitting into it and the spice had a small kick to it. The crust was so flaky yet not crumbly, and was not at all chewy like I find others to be. The greens were a nice complement to the chicken. All together it was a perfect meal for a considerably warm N.O. day. Oh and the Lemonade! A little sweet for my pallet, but nothing a little water couldn't fix. Once I poured a bit into it, it was God made goodness in liquid form! You could really taste the lemons in it which I really appreciated.  Two of my peers had the FC with Mac n' Cheese & Peas, and they could simply explain it as love on a plate. The third had the Catfish and she devoured it faster then we could get to half our plates. Now, I'm not a fish-eater so I didn't care for the texture though the meat was really good. It seemed to have the same spice as the FC and it didn't taste fishy at all.   We also had a couple of Corn Bread muffins...(Which I'm normally not a fan of either)...They were so soft and fluffy and not at all mushy or dry which always seems to be a turnoff with other corn breads. And the very last thing we all shared (it was a pretty big plate) was Butter Beans. I've never before had them and can only describe them as beans in its own gravy. Though that might not seem very appetizing it really was amazing!  The service was very pleasant and the wait wasn't very long at all. It had a almost homey feel to it even though there isn't much of a theme to the place. And the workers were super kind and sweet.

We got the bruschetta and shaved Brussels sprouts for appetizers, and the pork shoulders and beef cheeks for entrees. The bruschetta was great and I loved the flavor of it, but the shaved Brussels were a different story. I personally don't know why everyone was talking about them on Yelp because I found it very dry.   As for the entree, my mom really wasn't crazy about her pan-seared pork shoulders because it was made like a patty and also dry.

I did and then came back the next night for a second meal. This is unual for me to do while I am in New Orleans as I like to eat my way across the city. The first night I had the Roasted Portuguese Sardines, While this is not a dish for everyone their preparation was excellent and all that was left on my plate were the head and tails. They were seasoned and roasted to perfection. As my entrée I chose the Trout Campfire with fingerling potato fried egg and lemon butter. A dangerous preparation because if it is not watched carefully it is easy to overcook the fish - mine was perfect.  My only letdowns were with the white wines that were available by the glass.  I tried several white wine offerings and found them weak and tasteless. The white wines were not up to the standards of the food. I also did not have desert as they were sold out of one of my choices and the other choice was not yet prepared. But I came back the next day for meat.  The second night I started with the House Charcuterie Board (YUM!) and a glass of Spanish Tempranillo (a nice wine). I chose the Beef Short Ribs Bourguignon with buttermilk spaetzle and farm vegetable as my entrée (YUM YUM). Thus was a hearty robust flavorful dish that evoked memories eating the one of those special out of the way restaurants that one sometimes finds in France.  It was French comfort food at its best. I paired this with a glass of the Cote du Rhone.  Both of the red wines were quite good and complemented the food - much better than the whites I had the previous night. The desert - creme brulee- was good and I paired it with a medium dry sherry. A good meal.   The staff were all great and well trained and contributed to a wonderful experience both nights.  I will eat here next time I am in New Orleans because there are many appetizers, and entrees choices that I would love to try. This is a winner!

This place had the best reviews and is conveniently located so I went to check them out.   Scheduling was super easy, and there wasn't a wait when I got there for my appointment. Filled out a couple of forms then waited for less than a minute before the doctor came out.   In the small world that's New Orleans, turns out I actually knew her from working together a decade ago. As she was checking my eyes, we played catch up with everyone we knew. We both agreed that our former place of employment hasn't been the same since the storm. And neither of us have been back in ages. The exam- even with the catch up- was under 20 minutes. I told her I found my eye doctor!  Then my favorite part of my trip began. I examined almost every frame they had in stock. They had tons that were under $100 and even had another room in the back for the ones under $79.  I ended up grabbing one from the back since I knew I was going to spend an arm and a leg on my lens.   And I was right! Lenses were $300 because of my prescription and astigmatism. I decided to get the nicest ones they've got. No coke lenses for me!  It took me a couple of weeks to figure out my insurance coverage and which credit card to put everything on. They worked with me the entire time and were just generally very nice and patient.   Glasses were finally ordered, and I was quoted 5-7 business days. It ended up taking less than 3 days!

I joined their e-club online in which I supply them my email address and receive information about special promotions and deals and decided to visit this location for ""Free Croissant Day,"" or ""Bonjour to Fall.""   I do sometimes get actual meals or food items from La Madeleine, but this time I went to just get the croissant since I had a fruit salad with me and wanted to take advantage of the nice, fall weather and bring my food to Audubon Park. I asked the lady at the register for the promotional croissant, she turned and told what looked to be a manager and told her about my free croissant inquiry. This woman angrily mocked my by shouting ""Free croissant day,"" rolled her eyes and shoved a croissant into a bag and tossed it at the checkout girl. This croissant made it's way to me, and the manager-esque lady snarkily told me ""Bon appetite, have a nice day.""   I'm sure that the chain decided on this promotion to entice customers to come to the cafe in hopes of making other purchases. I do come to La Madeleine for their soup and sometimes their pastries, but this experience reminded me why I hate chains. Free croissant or not, this experience just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be coming back to this location and would like to recommend others do the same. My croissant was nothing special, and normally at $2.00 a pop, it's no steal to visit this chain.

3311,AT&T,29.916063,-90.114308,18.0,THIS STORE IS NOT CLOSED!  It is a store no longer associated with being an AT&T core store.  Forget going to this store as it has horrible customer service.  I went in after going online to see how to trade in my iPhone.  Online I was given an amount which could not be honored at the store since they are not a 'core' store.   The first thing the salesperson did was remove the glass plate off of the top of my phone to see if there was any damage. I had told him in advance that the glass protector plate was applied when I initially purchased the phone so there would be no damage.  In fact it was easy to see because the protector plate was clean.  Once I was told that they could only give me half of the quoted amount because they are no longer an AT&T store they sent me to the Lakeside store.  Before I left I asked for assurance that they would be able to handle my account.  Of course I get to the Lakeside store and the salesperson smells like onions which is disgusting.  He either wants me to buy the new iPhone directly or go on the Next plan which he doesn't explain well to me at all.  I leave very frustrated and try to contact the Tchoupitoulas store to tell them I'm coming back to get my protector plate for my phone which was thrown away.  No one answers the phone after repeated calls.  Once I arrive at the Tchoup store I'm told no one answered the phone because I was calling the wrong number.  Apparently their old number is still listed in the At&T directory assistance because that is the number I was given.  The poor service only escalated and I was given back the protector plate which can't be reapplied without looking like trash.  I am a long time AT&T customer.  This is how you LOSE customers.

He said we you didn't say anything when I said I had order the keys. You should've said something. He completely blamed me and thinks I I should know what I need to order when they know what they do and what they make. Really to get mad at me when I don't know what they're doing.

She said what you can make it out of A cheaper metal? He said ""yes"". Wife said why didn't you tell me my options. The guy said ""you should know"". What!?!?

I had the combination fried rice, which included shrimp, pork, chicken, and both white and green onions. The portions are HUGE but they lack flavor. Plus, the rice was simply too greasy.

SP is one of the few stores in the city where you can get almost all special release shoes during a release like yeezy boosts and many jordan brand items, but like I said before, it would be through a raffle system, so you'd have to be lucky.

Floors were clean. 3 stars  Overall: I like the look of this place, and it's filled with neat stuff. I cannot distinguish it well from other stores of its type in the area, so I consider it average.

If you are a light sleeper, this could be a problem, with bars open until 2am or later, a fire station right across the street and lots of traffic all day & night.  The king bed had nice linens & the matress was very comfy.  This room had a tub, which I don't think all of their rooms do.  The staff is friendly & helpful.  The Continental breakfast is not much, except for the good granola.  Otherwise, we passed on their breakfast for better options in the Quarter.  Can't beat the location.  We bought a day-pass on the bus/trolley system for $5.  This allowed us to take the Riverfront Trolley to the Canal Street Line to the St. Charles Avenue line...definitely saved us some money.

However, after a friend convinced me to go here again, I started to like the place more and more. Sooner than you know it, I had convinced and persuaded all my friends to come here. A great place to go to if you are around the neighborhood and it's 3am and all the bars around are close, but you still have a stomach for a drink. The drinks are cheap, and the year-round Christmas lights really give it a unique feeling. Would definitely recommend this place if every bar in town is closed and you are still alone without a girl wrap around your arms.",Nightlife

And no matter your mode of transportation (walk, drive, bike, Falkor, etc) head to Bywater American Bistro and order yourself some of the most creative and mouthwatering food New Orleans has to offer! The dishes offered at this neighborhood brew pub are heralded as Viet-Cajun, and we loved all of it!  We started our meal off with the cheesy egg rolls, and knew we were in for quite a treat. The outside was a perfectly crisped egg roll wrapper that crunched with each bite. Inside had mounds of oozing, gooey cheese. They were like mozzarella sticks with even more flavor than normal. For our meal we shared the  Phorrito, which had Sliced Roast Beef, rice noodles, onions, scallions, thai basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, sriracha, hoisin wrapped in a hot flour tortilla with a side of pho broth gravy for dips, and the Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos. The Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos has so many words in the title and even more flavors to enjoy! Fried wonton chips, chedder & cojita cheese, scallions, cilantro made for the perfect pairing for each of the beers we tried.  As for the beer selection, it was very impressive. We tried a few as it was happy hour pricing (bonus!) While they had many selections you'd expect, we really liked their Vienna lager spiked with New Orleans Chicory coffee because it felt like something you could only get in the Big Easy. It was almost as bold as the Deb Does Chocolate - Chocolate Stout which featured mammoth amounts of flavor.   We loved our experience so much that each night during our visit we contemplated eating at Bywater Brew Pub a second (or even third) time! The customer service was stellar too. Our waiter was so chill and friendly that I wanted to be their friend. This added to the overall dope vibe of their venue, which was very welcoming and gave off the feel of a neighborhood chill zone!",Restaurants

When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.  Finally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.  I called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found.   IHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase.

I tried the steak street tacos, and they were exactly what I wanted - corn tortilla, delicious steak, onions and cilantro. They also gave me some house salsa when I asked for some, and it was really good.

What a shame because its design and location lends itself to having great potential, but Tempt misses the mark by a mile.   The staff seem undertrained and super duper S L O W!  Ugh!  The entire thing seems like a complete after thought. I think my experience was tainted not only by the terrible food, inept service, but  by the fact that someone decided that the peak breakfast hour was ideal timing to repair a window.    Not only did they block many of the tables in this tiny restaurant, but there were contractors, workmen, ladders, equipment and all kinds of noise going on. This type of work should have been done either earlier or after hours when the restaurant is not serving food to patrons!! BIG mistake by management.  Hopefully, they will work the kinks out, but I fear it may not be in time to save this stinker of a restaurant. There are way too many incredible places in NOLA to spend your hard earned money and this my friends is not one of them.",Restaurants

Everything here is delicious, and delicious in it's own right.  They also have plenty of selections that are in no way vegan or even vegetarian. There's a maple bacon sweet potato biscuit that's killer and I usually see a quiche or two in the case when I'm there, as well.   There's a little room behind the front counter with some tables and chairs if you want to hang out there for a bit. I find the chairs to be a bit uncomfortable if I spend more than an hour or so on one, but I just take that as motivation to get the hell on with the rest of my day and not spend the entirety of it in a cafe.

539,La Vie En Rose Cafe,29.9398338,-90.0797510846,18.0,"Words cannot even describe the essence and quality of La Vie En Rose Cafe. If you read no further, just hear this: this cafe is a gem, from drinks to service to ambiance, it is so special and you would be doing yourself a favor to visit!  (food + drink review first, overall review below) I ordered their signature ""La Vie En Rose Latte"" hot. The latte was beautiful, and had the perfect amount of sweetness to make it enjoyable. A nice, palatable drink, without any stark flavors that might put one off.   If you're looking for a super sweet refresher, I recommend the ""Hibiscus Punch"" which is a mixture of hibiscus tea, lemonade, and vanilla (best part). The flavors are so beautifully paired with the vanilla adding a nice unique profile, and of course it comes iced so perfect for a summer day.   For food, there are an array of pastries served. I had the almond croissant, which was fresh and delicious. However, don't be disappointed if you are looking for a hot meal or full menu. This place does the drinks right, and offers some tasty snacks to pair.  Now, the holistic experience: Visiting New Orleans for the summer, I have sought out coffee shops and cafes a plenty, but I was so fortunate to stumble upon this cafe by accident. Two ladies exiting urged me to go inside when I arrived, and I immediately understood why. Walking in takes your breath away, as you uncover a magical world inside. Entirely unsuspecting, I was too giddy to order at first and had to explore. The cafe is owned by a beautiful woman, Kirby, and is run at the storefront. In partnership with a Neon Art collective, the space is filled with neon art and displays, as their workshop lies at the back.   I was in awe when entering because you are immediately surrounded by bright lights, beautiful colors, and honestly dope displays. This coffee shop-meets-neon art space is genius. You literally are sitting in art, and I will say it is probably the best overall interior I have ever seen.  Now, I cannot write this review without remarking on owner, Kirby. She runs the cafe with the most positive energy, and creates a quality experience. To see a woman of color owning and running such a stellar business was refreshing and inspiring, and (especially being in New Orleans) her inclusion of Creole heritage/traditions in the cafe's story and even the menu made me  more eager to support.  She crafted each beverage herself, and was so attentive to all customers. Perhaps most important, the atmosphere. Of course the aesthetic of neon lights and fixtures in addition to beautiful music made this place feel unearthly. But the environment of comfort, glee, and community was even more evident in the customers themselves. Many gathered to share conversations with friends or loved ones, and even strangers connected (myself included). It felt natural  to spark a short conversation with those sitting around you, and pleasant exchanges were abundant.   Overall, I suppose I can't express enough how unique and amazing La Vie En Rose is. The menu items were stellar, the service was splendid, and looking around to enjoy the neon art was perhaps the most exceptional component. Even just being in the company of others and enjoying the spot on a rainy day felt like an escape. It was an uplifting experience, beyond a simple coffee shop. Truly special.",Restaurants

On top of that he was on the phone with a customer and didn't know the answer to the customers question I answered it for him but he completely ignored me and left the customer clueless as to what he/she was looking for. Please please please hire people who actually know what they're talking about.",Shopping

With all of the bites of food & drinks made out of the cookies, I kind of felt like I was on the verge of a diabetic coma by the end of it, but everything was SO GOOD.  I did feel like the event itself was a little... slow? I'm not sure if that's the right word. There just wasn't much to ""do"" after making our way around to all of the sampling stations, besides sit, chat, and enjoy the band. We left pretty early on. As enjoyable as the band was - and they had a great singer - there's only so much sitting around that I can do, especially while my stomach was full of sugar.

Today's mission was: candles.  So, twice a year Bath and Body works has a major sale. They have one sale in the beginning of June and another right after Christmas. This is when I really stock up on my Bath and Body works goodies. I mean, when you can get a $14 body spray for $4, you make a point of planning your bath goods shopping around these sales. I already hauled some major finds from the Oakwood location, so I stopped in here to check out the candle selection. Um...three wick candles for $12?? Yes, please. This is the time of year that I stock up on stuff to give people for Christmas and birthdays. They had all season candles on sale, so I was sure to get a bunch and heads up pumpkin lovers: pumpkin scented everything is priced to move and fall is right around the corner.  A super helpful sales girl, who just happens to have my same name (minus one 'le'), was good about pointing me in the right direction of where I could find the best deals.

Today I decided to go in because I really like some of the shoes that they have. After being in the store for a short while I had found at least two pair of shoes that I wanted to purchase and was looking for more. Then abruptly this gentleman walked up to me, he didn't have an a badge or anything else that would have told me that he was an employee of the store. He then proceeded to tell me that I could not drink my coffee in the store, and that I had to leave it at the front counter. It is concerning to me that someone would ask any customer to leave a beverage unattended, just sitting at a counter. As far as I could tell, while looking around, there were no signs that said that beverages were not allowed in the store. And even if there were, this store is greatly lacking in customer service. So as much as I would like to purchase some items from the store, I won't just because of the shitty service.

Our server was really friendly and gave us a quick rundown of the menu, and we got the crawfish beignet as an appetizer from the checking on Yelp. Apparently the appetizer isn't free like the Yelp check-in says but it's -$10 for whatever appetizer you get. Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food including two platters of oysters, and we then we started waiting. And waiting. After maybe twenty minutes, our first platter of oysters came, closely followed by the second plate. We noticed the second plate wasn't what we ordered so we asked the waiter who took it back. We then waited for another twenty or thirty minutes for our food, and our entrees came. Our oysters never did. We told the waiter and he said there was a mixup and our oysters were given to the table next to us. The manager came by afterward and told us that she'd give us two orders of what we got on the house (too bad I don't really eat oysters). So I ate my crawfish etouffee and it was quite good. A bit salty, but good. Nice spicy flavor and a good amount of crawfish, both fried bits on top and in the sauce. I asked for more bread as well so I could soak up the sauce. I quite enjoyed that dish. When the oysters finally came after we had already all finished our meal (this was probably another 10-15 minutes), the Rockefeller oysters came and I tried one. Way too much cheese on top! Otherwise I think ok as far as oysters go. Then we asked for the check do which also took at least five minutes to get here. My crawfish dish was $17 pre-tax which is a bit pricey, and combined with the mixup and the super long waiting times, I wouldn't suggest coming here. The waiter apologized many times for the mixup which is fine, but it doesn't excuse the super long wait times for our main entrees. To be fair, my food (the crawfish etouffee) was quite good and deserves 4 stars, but the long long long wait and inefficiencies (I'm excusing the mix-up with the oysters because there was a miscommunication which I understand happens - what isn't excusable is how long we waited for our entrees/other dishes, the check, etc etc) subtracted 1 star.",Restaurants

The mac and cheese was good as was the potato salad, but again they lacked any exceptional flavor.  The greens lacked flavor too, even though she said they were cooked with pork.

I selected Provolone cheese for his sandwich and that was a HUGE mistake, he said his sandwich had NO flavor no matter how hard he tried he just couldn't finish.  I wrapped the other half up just to toss it in the trash.  As for the fries they looked as if they were soaked in oil over night and then left in the fryer while it warmed up.

I ordered the Philly Steak and Cheese combo, which cane with fries and a canned drink for $10. If you use a credit card, they charge sales tax; so pay by cash to avoid the additional $1.   Overall, the meal was fine. The sandwich was about a foot long filled with meat, cheese and peppers. It was light on mayo and I wished there had been more. While the fries were dusted with what looked like creole seasoning, they still lacked flavor. However, they were hot, crispy and plentiful. When I make fries at home, I just use salt and pepper and they are the bomb.com. For some reason these fries were missing something and I couldn't figure out what. Fat maybe? Or maybe it was the particular brand.   The filling was tasty, but I think I would've preferred po-boy bread because the hoagie was chewier than I would've liked.

So we were then allowed to order.  This has happened a couple times and I get needing a breather if you've been busy but the place has just kind of lost its appeal for our weekend breakfasts. I don't mind waiting at all and don't even need anyone to be particularly nice! But it is nice to go other places where they're happy to see their customers and pleasant to interact with.

It is very close to Ochsner Hospital and a lot of the nurses and staff come here for lunch. At night, it is always pretty empty, which could account for that smell I am talking about. Maybe they start cleaning the floors at night when I go in to pick up my food. The service is always pretty snappy and served with a smile. I like this place and I try to sponsor it when I can.

Honestly, it looks a little sketchy from the outside... Don't let that scare you away. Inside it's warm and inviting.

They brought out our salads first, then our pasta, which I liked. Service was quick and friendly!  Now for the food... It was pretty good! They were doing 50% off Small Plates, so my boyfriend and I both started out with the Caesar Salad, which was honestly not great. (There's no Parmesan or pepper on it!) The crouton was really tasty though, and I added Parmesan at the table. Not bad for being $3, though I might have been annoyed if I had paid $6. As for pasta, both of us did Make-Your-Own. (It's what made me want to come here in the first place.) I ordered the Rigatoni w/ Grandma's Bolognese (+ Italian Sausage). My boyfriend, who is Celiac and therefore gluten-free, got the Gluten-Free Fusili w/ Puttanesca (+ Gulf Shrimp). Overall, we loved and were really impressed by the housemade pasta. Both of us thought the sauces were really flavorful too, though if I returned I'd probably choose something less traditional. Boyfriend really, really liked the gluten-free pasta. It is, amazingly, housemade as well! (We found this out because Boyfriend liked it so much he asked what brand it was and they said they make it in the back. Nice!)  Overall, this is a great casual place with tasty food. I also really like the flexibility of the Make-Your-Own Pasta option. Seems like it provides a little something for everyone.

Having said that, it's a beautiful venue and if the staff during the latest Yelp even help there (Either the bloody blash or the bloody bash, depending on the #hashtag), It's a very nice space. Yes it's beside a very questionable strip of Canel/Elk, but the venue itself is really quite nice. It reminded me a bit of a smaller version of the Fox Theatre in Detroit.   I am reviewing this seperately from the event Yelp hosted here. I made sure I studied it for just itself.  P.S. If the staff is the same all the time as it was the night of the event, then they were not only efficient, but amazingly graceful, even for the cheap a-holes who didn't tip.  Yes.

Falafels were fresh and excellent blend of flavor.  The Chicken in pita was excellent too ... fresh salad and sauce added flavor. French fries were fresh too (they seemed to be cut on site and not frozen).    Chef Dan is not only a great chef, but truly understands customer service. I was visiting the area with my family and stopped by for lunch.  Tulane's campus was essentially closed with students on break so the restaurant closed early and had a limited menu.  Regardless, Dan (who had already started cleaning the kitchen) was still willing to cook for us.   I would recommend Rimon to anyone visiting the area looking for a kosher meal.  The menu was limited on our visit, but their regular menu seems to be very diverse.  I will have to come back for Bubbie's Brisket Sandwich.

They had a tiny bit of kick to the balance out the sweetness and were cooked perfectly. The potato was huge and I definitely had half leftover. It could have used some extra toppings because it's a lot of potato to eat with it, but overall I was happy with my choice.   My SO got the Buffalo chicken potato and a side of macaroni and cheese. I had a bite of his potato and thought it had great flavor. I unfortunately didn't try his macaroni and cheese but he said it was delicious.

We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat. The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.

The bartender was nice enough and did pour a petty stiff drink.  A little too stiff for my taste.  There was not much going on and it was really not our type of place, so we took our drinks and left.  The prices were good for NOLA and we would stop in again for a to go drink if in the area.

The service is impeccable and the food is what you would expect from an old school steakhouse. This a true meat and potatoes place and why my husband loves it. It is, to be candid, not my type of restaurant. I like food that is a little more creative and lighter. However, to celebrate my husband's birthday, we needed to get what he wanted and what the man always wants is STEAK! No frills, just a good man steak. With that said, I did enjoy my meal, especially the onion rings. They are crisp and super thin just the way I like them. I really enjoyed the filet I had as well, and my husband had no complaints and no leftovers of his cow sized steak. And though I tried to get him to go to where there is a tad more flare, we are going back again for his birthday this year. But I am looking forward to a predictably good meal and service (and a great coolinary deal!) After all, if you want some good meat and potatoes, Charlie's is the place to go!  Update: We just went back for our third visit and the onion rings, steak, and service were great! However, we were seated upstairs, and I must say the decor is unappetizing!

The regular size of queso is literally a condiment cup like at a fast food restaurant- the small is actually the size of a cap you would take cough medicine in- I'm not kidding. Quesadillas are made from damp tortillas with a one big ol' slice of cheese slightly melted in the middle. I asked for a little bit of rice with my quesadilla and I kid you not, they probably gave me ten grains. There is a reason it's so dang cheap. Although coveted by Tulane freshmen for its accessibility from campus, cheap eats, and late hours, it is not meant for anyone who is 1. Sober or 2. Has any tastebuds. Tried to give it one last chance before graduating and it just reminded me why I've avoided it for four years- HARD PASS.

But with out the sour cream and guac, and lite on the cheese and you got yourself a pretty healthy lunch. If course if your feeling like you need to just indulge you can get all the fat stuff instead, but I need to try to be good at lunch time. They also have tortilla soup and black bean soup every day which makes me very happy. They have huge Mexican combo plates with tacos, burritos, flautas, etc. but you can also get everything a la carte. I will express my happiness that they have a grilled veggie option again!

I love trying food from vendors who don't have their restaurants yet like Miss Linda Yakamein Lady and Cook Me Somethin Mister Jambalaya.  I love that some of the sponsors are The New Orleans Saints and Pelicans so you get an opportunity to see Gumbo or the Dance Squads and take photos of or with them. If you are lucky you may even catch a shirt that they shoot with a blaster in the Crowd.  The only drawback to the Park I think is not enough seating area closer to the stage.

They made me feel like I was being a problem but in retrospect, they were probably feeling overwhelmed/overworked and cranky. They really had poor work performance.   I went in to get folders and a couple of copies of my resume. Two of four employees were very condescending about me requesting a particular type of resume paper, which should've been a non-issue. I liked the resume paper offered at the print station. The person working there sent me to the isle to buy a pack. But, the item was NOT there. (One guy told me ""it's just paper"", and indicated that I should just pick something. (He obviously hadn't looked in my buggy though. I had already selected a back up option BEFORE I made it to the print station.. .) Anyway, I'd feel like a clown presenting a resume on blue or almond colored resume paper. It's a matter of personal style, I guess. I just wanted the product that I like.) Another guy was intentionally nonchalant, and one was too busy to remember details long enough to be helpful.  It was a very uncomfortable trip (and took up a lot of time). I wound up buying prints that I didn't want because the store was OUT of a few types of paper. I wound up buying two prints of each document. The third copy had mix-matched paper. I did not purchase that.",Shopping

The Jambalaya Supreme, Shrimp Creole and Red Beans and Rice are wonderful. They have local beers which are good and change from time to time.

This place was perfect, a small hideaway in the Hyatt on Iberville. Clean, trendy, with nice cocktails that were about the price you'd expect (~$13 ea).   Staff was very friendly, my bartender was very nice and made the drinks well but not with the casual familiarity of someone who does this day in day out.   The display of barrel aged potables behind the bar is very pretty and very tempting, but from a layout perspective it sucks for the staff. As an industrial engineer, I am maddened by poor process flow, and the poor bartender had to walk all over the place just to make a sazerac and a mule. I can't imagine how much worse that would have been if this place had been busy and there had been multiple bartenders...  This place would be four stars anywhere else, but New Orleans has a pretty high density of awesome places... so we're down to three.

I usually take the register value to the face, but I DID wonder why I paid $60 for everything. Now I know why.  This store is miserably stocked. I walked in looking for a soap dish, to which the manager (I believe she was, I noticed on quick glance that she was writing employee schedules) told me they were out. THIS is what I'd initially arrived to this family dollar for, when I decided to pick up ONE pair of shoes. At which point I was charged THREE TIMES for it! I'm annoyed at myself for missing this, yes, but...Why? Just...Why? The socks I purchased also never had the security tag removed, so I'll be going back to sort this mess out.

It took them a while to make me another one. They were so busy having loud conversations with their friends visiting the restaurant. I was so upset that when they gave me the sandwich that I didn't bother to check it. I guess they figured they'd teach me a lesson because when I got home one of the cooks had stabbed my bun about four times with their finger. I got in touch with the owner and she pretended that she couldn't figure out who was working there that day. Really??? At your restaurant? Ok.

Nobody ever came to acknowledge us and by the time someone did come about 20 minutes later we didn't want to stay. So Saturday we decided to give this place a shot again. Service is still slow. I'm not sure why the bartender was supposed to also be our server instead of focusing on the bar. There were like two other servers and a hookah girl there. Also saw maybe a manager, so I'm not sure why nobody was working their appropriate sections. And I don't think they have table numbers because the servers were confused where orders were going. But back to my experience. The wait was getting so bad that someone else decided to take care of us. I think she saw the aggravation in our faces. She took our drink order and of course that took a while. We also ordered hookah. They were out of one of the flavors we wanted. The hookah took FOREVER to come out. Finally it came out. The hookah burned so fast it was crazy how fast it was burning out. We saw someone else send their hookah back and leave. Also, there was a $5 charge to add ice to the hookah and if I'm not mistaken there's also a charge for them to change your coal. It was all interesting. The best thing about this place was the fries and music. Again, I want to see them step up in the service and hookah area. This place has potential but some things need some tweaking.",Restaurants

Their ""deep dish"" pizza is true Chicago style, consistent with the location out in Metairie which is one of the few places outside of Chicago that I have ever had true Chicago style pizza.  On an initial visit to the new location of That's Amore on St. Charles they were able to make a custom pie for me before the crowds got too big and it was really good with a nice spicy tomato sauce on top and crumbled sausage so you get a little in every bite (though the crust was a bit too thick which led it to be undercooked and yeasty which my wife disliked).  On a subsequent visit I tried a slice of wood fired pepperoni pizza which was better than the most recent incarnation of Dolce Vita.  It doesn't sound like they'll be doing true ""Neopolitan"" pizza but they've got a great wood fired oven that they inherited from the old Dolce Vita business at this location and they're doing a nice thin crust option - not New York Style like their location in Metairie and not Neopolitan style but just a great thin crust wood fired pizza.  If you can do a good job during a Mardi Gras opening, I'm confident this place will be rock solid once they get some sleep.  :)   The owner is high energy and personable and it's unquestionably one of the few places outside of Chicago that you'll be able to get a true Chicago style pie.

You place your order at the kitchen and wait for your name to be called. That's my favorite time, where you stand back and choose from the 100+ options of soft drinks and beverages from the coolers lining the long wall. After a short while, your name is called and --whew man!-- the food is exactly what you were looking for. I tried most of everything over the years and the Maple Feast is my usual option. The french fry po boy is also a good choice as well.  Favori is good for a quick bite, better if you're hungover.

Most of the ""Garden"" stores in the GNO area seem to focus on landscape ornaments and knick-knacks, but Harold's has plants, trees, bushes, and all sorts of gardening accessories.  Harold's a bit odd. We noticed that he tended to roam around the store a bit, but his encyclopedic knowledge of plants was very obvious and he was nothing less than personable. The whole experience had very much of a ""mom and pop"" experience, and it's very different than shopping at Home Depot or Lowes (and most of the other garden stores in the area).

I haven't had a lot of gin, but the punch went down really smoothly and I could barely taste the alcohol. I know this might not be everyone's thing, but I liked it.  The distillery and bar itself is huge, and was perfect for the event I was attending. There was a big room in the front with a bar and another bar in the back with plenty of seating, including booths, if you don't want to sit at the actual bar.

I hope they can adjust a few things quickly at Justine.  First, our table was ready and we were sat quickly, and the hostess commented with a sigh of relief, ""At least your table is ready."" The ambience is very cool, and I love the vibe of the decor. We sat and about 10 minutes later we were greeted by our server. He was very pleasant and clearly experienced, but overwhelmed with how long drinks and food were taking for his tables.  We ordered a bottle of wine, and I thought the wine list was solid. Good choices in a range of prices.  We ordered the oysters en perseillade and bone marrow app. It took about 30 minutes to receive our appetizers. The oysters were cooked perfectly and my favorite dish of the night. The bone marrow was over cooked and the marrow was lost in the mashed potatoes, which were average potatoes. We sadly sent back the marrow, because we could not find any. If the marrow was laid to the side and cut differently, the dish could work.  For entrees, which took about 45 minutes after appetizers, we ordered the short ribs, spinach gratin, and shrimp en papillote. The short ribs and spinach were very good. The shrimp were raw, cold and brown. I had to send it back and obviously sending out raw food is not ok. Instead of putting it in another piece of paper and placing them back into the oven, they grilled the shrimp and did not cook the vegetables again that were in the paper with the raw shrimp. I sent it back a second time, because I did not order grilled shrimp and because of the vegetables. I assume the kitchen thought this was ok, but I was very excited to see this on the menu and would not have ordered grilled shrimp. This was the main reason I was disappointed, having a major problem with a main dish and not fixing it correctly. Food integrity should be important to a chef and his kitchen. Although a manager came by after the food was sent back, a manager should have dropped off the food the second time. I felt so bad for our server.  I ordered the mussels instead and they were typical mussels. We had the gateau for dessert and it was great.  I suggest waiting and let the kitchen work out the kinks before dining here. Also, be prepared to wait for your food on busy nights. From my view, the beef entrees are what work best. I sadly won't be returning.",Restaurants

The chocolate bites are larger than an M&M and more rounded than a Smarties.  These bites are spicy on impact, but don't leave you watery-eyed. The spiciness helps bring out the amazing flavor of the dark chocolate. These aren't the type of chocolate that only burns as it goes down the throat, making you cough.

It was cooked to perfection and the meat was very tender and flavorful. This meal came with the Kale salad and mashed potatoes as well, but you could get the spinach or other vegetable if you prefer.  My spouse ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye and said it was the best they had ever had. Tender, juicy and full of flavor. This meal came with mashed potatoes as well.  I had the Center cut steak, and I get mine well done. This is the most tender steak I have ever had. I have eaten at other high end steak houses, like Ruth Chris, and this was by far, the best steak I have ever had. (Please note that Ruth Chris's was very good when we went a few years ago, before I knew about Yelp!) Most know that when you order a well done steak, you just know it will be dry, a little burnt, and need something to give it flavor. This is just something you get used too, but not here.  I was shocked! Really shocked. This steak was moist, had just the right amount of spices and just melted in your mouth.  My meal came with a baked potato, which was very big and very good.

3217,J's Island Fish House,29.9618425,-90.0576285,3.0,"This was a pretty dismal experience in all aspects.  1. Staff Attentiveness: BF and I walk in the front door. There is one seated table inside, about 4 on the patio. We stand there for... 3 minutes or so without being approached. Finally walk out to the patio and stand there for another minute or so. Finally walk up to the bar and ask: ""Should we seat ourselves?"" Bartender: ""Yes, someone will be right there."" Five minutes later, a table of 5 sits next to us. Within a minute they have a server. We have yet to have any staff person do anything except look at us when walking by. Finally someone comes and tells us that the big table (maybe 10 people?) that was seated before we got there has ""all the menus"" and that they'll bring us one when they're done. Starts to walk away, and then stops, ""Can I get you a drink?"" YEAH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. We ask for water and coke, and say that we'll order more to drink after we see the menu. Menu and drinks come. We wait 10 minutes before we can order, at which point I ask what red wines they have, and clarify: ""I don't need label names, just TYPES of red wine, Merlot, Cab..."" Waitress says she's not sure, gets the wine menu. I order a glass of wine, BF orders a beer. We order 1 app for first service, and then 1 salad and 1 entree for dinner.  20 minutes later: we get the app.  And more water. Still no booze. 10 mintues later (mind you, this is THIRTY [30!!] minutes after we ordered it), booze arrives. 25 minutes later, entrees arrive. The only thing that happened quickly was getting the check.  2, FOOD Menu is very NOLA touristy, mixed with ""Carribean"" flair: po-boys, fried fried fried, jerk ___, etc. NOT vege friendly. Pescatarian (like me!) friendly, but you better be in the mood for fried. a. fried green tomatoes with prawn ($11) two small slices tomatoes, overly coated and good only if you peeled half the breading off. 1 giant prawn with no flavor to speak of. b. Caeasar salad ($7? $9?): standard lettuce and dressing (surprisingly underdressed, however). Nice touch: grape tomatoes. House made croutons: good flavor, too big for comfort.  c. Shrimp pasta ($17? something outrageous): TERRIBLE. Clearly cheap frozen shrimp (all 5? 6? of them), terrible sauce. BF couldn't even finish it. And he eats some crap, I tell you what.   3. Which brings me to COST. Standard NOLA tourist menu, with over exobitant prices. Charging me $2 more for my glass of wine than what was listed on the menu? HUGE mistake. That kinda stuff comes out of your tip.  Anyway: The bill was entirely too high for the quality of the food or the service. If it's going to cost me $60 for dinner for two, it better be edible, and I better have service that doesn't infuriate me.  4. Ambience: the courtyard is AMAZING. Pretty and quiet - you forget you're steps away from Frenchmen St. We happened to be there on one of the first fall nights after the long hot summer. So that was extra good. 80s music on the speakers: always good. Singer/songwriter/guitarist who started playing midway though: eh.   Verdict: I wouldn't go again. Even if someone else was paying.   I know they're somewhat new, so I hope the service, kitchen timing, and menu/bill $$ discrepencies get worked out as they continue to operate.  However, time is not going fix that food.

846,Finger Lick'n Wings,29.927221,-90.074369,19.0,"As a transplant from outside of Buffalo, trying to find an acceptable chicken wing in New Orleans has been a depressingly daunting task.  In my search of the Southeast Louisiana for a good wing, it took a number of years before I found Finger Lick'n Wings.  While they are not quite as good as those in the Wing Motherland, they are the best around.  I have been going to this wing joint for years, and tried just about all the sauces.  My personal favorites include the Obama, St. Torcha, Mardi Gras, and Who Dat.  Just to note - they carry a huge selection of sauces, and are sure to have something that suits your fancy.  As far as the wings themselves, they are larger than the typical wing served around here, and are actually cooked correctly - which is apparently surprisingly difficult here in New Orleans.    Of of the time of this review, it appears that they are renovating the inside and painting the outside - I'll update if necessary.  They are mostly a takeout-based joint right now, but are trying to move to a dine-iin restaurant.  They are also pursuing a liquor license for the location.  I believe they has Barbecue on the menu for a while (around Mardi Gras), but I'm not sure the chef brought in to do it is still around.  Every time I visit something changes, usually for better.  On the downside (which is from a wing purist standpoint) they do not serve Bleu Cheese and Celery with the wings - the big strike keeping them from hitting five stars.  I cannot speak for the other food on the menu, since I stick with the wings.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and grab some wings Buck or Troy - you won't be disappointed!",Restaurants

9,The Music Box Village,29.9635911,-90.0292571,17.0,"Ok. Simply put, the Music Box Village is one of the COOLEST things I have ever experienced in my life. Everyone knows that New Orleans is full of magic but I think this spot may just be the most magical and whimsical place in town. For a while, the Music Box Village used to do pop-up shows in City Park, but now their permanent location is hidden in a nook and cranny in the Bywater that is almost impossible to just accidentally stumble upon. Personally, I think that adds to the whimsy of it because it gives me a very Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe kind of vibe. Make sure to pop the address into your GPS (it's at the end of the tracks behind Bar Redux). Some other logistical notes: limited parking so only park in the lot if you have children or need assistance (there is street parking available because it's nestled in a neighborhood), tix vary from 10-35 dollars per show (worth it), they do sell beer, there's usually a food pop-up (Congreso Cubano), kids are allowed, and no dogs (unless it's a service dog).  The New Orleans Airlift team has truly created a one of a kind experience. The venue is pretty large and is full of tiny house structures that are actually the instruments used in performances Truly, it's so hard to describe because of how mind-blowing it is, that you truly just need to visit it for yourself. Because of the setup, it's a completely immersive experience and there is no bad seat in the house (speaking of seats, you need to bring your own seats and folding chairs). It's the most original, innovative, and creative thing I've seen in a very long time. They have spring and fall shows that they usually put on and artists like Big Freedia, Solange Knowles, Wilco, and Tank and the Bangas have performed there over the last year.   Last night, I saw Tank and the Bangas perform an original piece that they developed themselves through their experimental music/spoken word/dance/art residency at the Music Box Village. In the middle of the performance, NORAH JONES rolls out on a mobile grand piano and performed a song. It was phenomenal. I've seen Tank and the Bangas perform many times but this was something totally different and unique in the best way possible.   If you are reading this, you have to check this place out for yourself. They open the village to the public during the daytime (hours and days are on their website) and I would highly suggest going, especially if you have kids. Admission is 12 bucks ($5 if you're local or a child). I highly suggest making it to a nighttime show though to fully get the magic of this spot. Even if you've seen a band a dozen times, the way the Music Box Village operates is so that the performance you are seeing there, will never/can never be replicated or done that same way again, so you are truly experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Magic. Pure magic.",Nightlife

The Satchmo Summerfest is a great event for everyone--including the kids.  During the Festival, the organizers offer educational lectures to the public, which chronicle the life and success of Louis Armstrong.  There are also food stands which serve classic New Orleans fare, and most importantly, the organizers make sure there is great music playing at every second.  There are multiple stages surrounding the old U.S. Mint where you can sit (or dance) in the shade and enjoy an alcoholic beverage and the sound of blaring music.  This year, the Festival coincided with the Napoleon exhibit in the old U.S. Mint, so the organizers gave the Festival-goers free admission to see the Napoleon-era relics that had come into town.

My husband - who can eat gluten - says their regular menu items aren't anything to sneeze at either.  The fries also really good!  They have practically anything you could imagine wanting as a topping, and have a vegetarian option. So, it's a pretty customer-friendly place.

Ideally, a place that specializes in the Bills filled with long suffering Bills fans would be good.  Throw in some decent chicken wings and Canadian beer and we would have a winner. If this place did exist, it would be attracting a pretty exclusive crowd -all the beautiful people -  intelligent, classy, incredible sense of style, witty.... you get the idea.  So, when I got a tip that there was a bar in the CBD that was making it's name as a Bills bar, I was intrigued.   Not a dive bar, someone has clearly spent a fair amount of money restoring the building to capture the dive look.  Its pretty nice.  Further proof? The acid test is always the bathroom - the fixtures are still white, no mold or mildew - clearly, they've been cleaned in the last 6 months.  No self respecting dive bar would be sporting white fixtures.  The decor is interesting.  What is with all the John Daly stuff?  Multiple TVs are available, about half tuned to the Bills game.  The Saints weren't playing at that time.  Need to see how many TVs are tuned to the Bills when they are playing at the same time.  The most Bills fans I have ever seen in one place in New Orleans.     It was great to ask for a ""Blue"" and have the bartender know what you are talking about.  If you're not familiar with the order, give it a try.    Chicken wings - decent size, crispy - the medium was totally lacking in fire.  I'll try hot next time.    NO SMOKING!  If you're from any of the enlightened states, you likely already appreciate the benefits of a ""no smoking"" bar.  If you spent your life south of I-10, you will learn to love it.

That's how they store the pita they use, it sits on a giant pile of unrefrigerated meat in the open. I'm vegan and asked incredulously if they had just pulled the pita off of the pile of meat. They actually said no, despite me having just seen it happen. Finally, they went back a took a pita from the top that had been resting on other pitas. I reluctantly said that would do, because I had already been there much longer than I had expected and was in a rush.

The wrap comes with your choice of fries or hummus and salad (we both opted for the latter because we had fries all day.) Since we ordered hummus, it came with an extra piece of pita bread.  My falafel wrap was amazing (there are pickles!) The falafel is crisped up nicely and has a great texture. I only wish that the pieces of falafel were a little bigger.

Most notably, I was there with a coworker to pick up a large online order totaling about $800 worth the lumber and miscellaneous materials.  The order was supposed to be cut to size and put aside for us when we called ahead to arrange a pickup.  That had not happened, and we waited FOR TWO HOURS before asking if we could do it ourselves (nevermind that I had come from work and was doing this in a pair or slacks, a shirt and tie).  Several employees came by in the meantime to vent about ""the day people"" whose responsibility it apparently was to pull our order, but did not lift a finger to assist us.  When we brought the lumber that needed to be cut to the back, the operator was very upset about having to cut all that wood ""that wasn't his job"".  Hey man, I get your upset, but I am the customer, it is not my fault your staff is dysfunctional.  After my coworker and I had loaded 96 8 ft 2x4's and 16 large sheets of plywood ourselves, the MANAGER came to introduce himself and apologize for the order not being prepared, assuring us that ""there would be consequences"" for the people responsible, while offering nothing to make things right for us, or compensate us for our labor and time that was wasted.  Does that man really think I am going to sleep better at night knowing that someone may lose their job this day in age?  What an inappropriate response to a glaring failure of customer service...seeing his lack of professionalism made the staff's lack of direction easier to understand.  The propane...don't get me started on the propane exchange there...firstly, I went in to exchange an empty cylinder, and an employee literally screamed at me to get the tank out of the store as if I had walked in with a dinosaur on a leash...Really, forgive me for not wanting to lose my deposit for leaving it outside...this is Central City after all.  After that, I was informed that they had no more propane (which was untrue), they just did not want to send someone out to the cages to look.  Turns out, 3/4 cages are on a key lock (which only one person has) and the last is on a combination lock (which multiple people have).  SO, when the cage with the combo lock gets empty, they would rather inconvenience a customer and lose business than take a minute to track down a set of keys.  Joke.  Silver lining, after this experience and others, I found a place to fill them rather than exchange them, which is a better value.
