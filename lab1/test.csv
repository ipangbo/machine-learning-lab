They won't come up to your room, which is okay, but I had to wait an hour and a half and my tracker said it was delivered so I called and they said he was leaving right then, it took another half hour after that.

2364,Joan Good Antiques,29.9591547,-90.0638928,20.0,"This is a lovely place on Royal St. known for its antique shops. Antique shops always draw me right in and the ones on Royal Street were no exception.  I've always been a sucker for a time-honored piece piece of jewelry.  I was lucky enough to get my husband's great-grandmother's engagement ring as my own.  This ring is originally from the Edwardian era which has led me to search out other pieces from that time or made in that style.  It was an interesting time in history following as it did the Victorian era which many of us tend to know more about.  At Joan Good Antiques, you'll find quite an array of jewelry, not all of it antique and not all of it precious.  It's just a fun treasure hunt  to look around to see what you might find on any particular visit.   Sifting through things is always half the excitement for me in going to antique shops whether it's for jewelry or anything else.  I did find some pieces with gorgeous metal work, beautiful gem stones and some captivating amber pieces.  I've become interested in cameos the last few years and there were a couple of nice examples here.  Alas, I didn't buy anything on this trip and there was nothing Edwardian this time; I was sorely tempted by a couple of things however.  I'll be back for another look-see on my next trip. A walk down Royal Street while in New Orleans is a must in my opinion and this is one of many antique places worth your while.   The antiques you find in various cities across the country provide another way of learning something about history so I think they're worth seeking out.",Shopping
530,The Other Bar,29.9350547,-90.1091205,3.0,"I would say this is just a glorified version of tailgating, but with a roof. The beer served are all canned or bottled and come out of various coolers around the room. The space is small, hot and not air conditioned. The prices are high considering what you ask for. At first the Pabst I ordered was $3. At the end of the night I was being charged $4. The first can of beer I was served had what appeared to be old, dried beer on the lid. I didn't notice it inside the dimly lit bar, or on the sidewalk outside where it was cooler. In fact, it wasn't until I was next door in the Comedy Theatre space with the lights up that I noticed I had my lips on a terribly unsavory can of beer. Pretty lucky I didn't get sick. Lastly, since there was a minimum on tabs paid with a card I had to order extra beers since I refused to pay $6 for a shot of Jameson. I won't be back.",Nightlife

Nice crowd, and there were still a couple of empty tables outside, so we stayed outside to enjoy one of our brief, beautiful Spring evenings.  My husband asked for the wine list and our waitress read from her cheat sheet what wines they had that evening.  He was a little surprised, but picked out a nice pinot noir for our dinner.  We started the meal with the mixed green salad.  We've had it before and I was looking forward to the candied almonds and Gorgonzola cheese over the mixed greens.  Katya did a good job on selling me on the Saturday night special, an 8 oz fillet Mignon, with a cheese topping, potato au gratin and a vegetable medley.  The steak was good, cooked as I requested.  My husband ordered the barbecue shrimp ravioli.  His plate was clean when we finished.  Enough said.  He liked it.  We were so full, we skipped dessert.  The chocolate cake sounded divine.  I have only compliments for our waitress, Katya.  She was there without hovering.  I liked that David came by and asked how everything was.

He was through with the aftercare needs of a piercing and answered all my questions. He is friendly and engaging and just a genuinely nice guy.   The only reason I give this 4 starts instead of 5 is because of pricing. Pricing is all on their website but I did not expect to pay $200 (tax and tip included in this total) to get my ears pierced. I was a little shocked at the pricing at first  but when you consider the type of equipment they are using and the earring quality, I think It's worth the investment.

The colors on the cabinet doors are not the same color stain as is on the main cabinetry.  Perhaps, this is specific only to the floor models, I couldn't say. The woman watching television in the store, did not speak to us or acknowledge us.    There was a child about 4 or so roaming about the showroom, obviously a relative of the employee.

I don't ever go to Nacho Mama's expecting five star cuisine - in fact, I am mainly there for the queso dip.  However, two weeks ago my husband and I went to Elmwood and had what may have been the best fish taco I've ever had and I was craving one, but trying to stay local.  Hence our visit to Magazine.  I ordered a 'rita; my husband a mojito.  They had to ""find"" some mint -  which it looked like they might have found in a pond.  Lots of slimy black floaties.  I returned that drink to the bar and trade it in on a 'rita.  Stuff happens, right?  Okay... We order our meals.  Fish tacos for the adults and a steak taco for our daughter.  Oh, and the aforementioned queso.  Chips and queso arrive after a reminder to our waitress.  The chips are greasy.  But I'm hungry, so I let it go.  Well, until I notice that the chip in my hand is greasy and *hairy*.  Sweet baby king cake Jesus.  Having waited tables, I can overlook a lot, but hair in food is a non-negotiable for me.  But I did instinctively flick it away and threw the offending chip to the floor.  I then removed the chips from play.  About that same time, our food arrived.  Have I mentioned we'd been there quite awhile?  Anyway, the tacos come wrapped in paper.  Oh good!  Yummy fish tacos at long last!  I unwrap mine and it's a) warmer than ice cold but colder than room temperature.  It's a temperature that cannot be blamed on the waitstaff.  This is simply a preparation issue.  My husband's are cold and so is my daughter's steak taco.  To their credit, although the rice was also stone cold, the black beans were nuclear hot.  And probably nuked, come to think of it.  Oh, and did I mention that my fish taco is some putrid pink/brown color.  Like Fancy Feast, but now with capers!  I should also mention that at this point I have forbidden everyone at the table from eating *anything* else.  But our waitperson is now MIA.  So I have to enlist another staffer to get the manager.  I do have to say that the manager handled everything well-  comped everything and offered to buy us dinner, but at that point...well, it's going to be awhile before I am ready to venture in again.

I am typically don't like french toast but, the online reviews made me curious enough to try.  The French toast was fantastic.  I prematurely poured a minimal amount of syrup on my toast before tasting the french toast.  That was a mistake; because after taking a bite, I realized I did not need to add anything to this masterpiece of flavor and sweetness.  Imagine that.  French toast made using French bread (who knew?  I think I need to get out more :) ).  It was so soft, flavorful,  and oh so sweet.  In my opinion, adding syrup to this dish was an insult and should have never been put on the table.   I took a slight issue with my scrambled eggs because I thought they were a bit salty.

First it was difficult to park and we paid over 30.00 to park in a ground lot near the restaurant. I never mind price if the experience and food are good. However this far from good..it was horrible. The floor in the restaurant is tilted and felt like we were sliding toward the wall. The place is loud and not comfortable. Such an acclaimed place and drinks were poor at best. When asked about simple syrup or bar sweetener they said they did not have any. Then we asked for orange juice to help the drink out and they told us they had no orange juice? Strange for a bar to not have such mainstays. The small plates or appetizer sounded interesting. That's not quite what I'd call them. The tuna was underwhelming and very small. The crawfish dish was the best of the 4 we ordered. The rest were strange and had numerous spices that clashed. Then we order dinner plates. The barbecued shrimp and grits was the best of the lot. The fish tasted spiked and the steak was over cooked. Sorry to report the dessert did not redeem the meal. It was good but not great. We had cheesecake, the pie and chocolate bar. The bathroom was limited as well to one while we were there... one wasn't working. The server tried very hard and couldn't have been nicer. But the service was so slow and took 2.5 hours to finish (and we returned two of the meals). To insult to injury, they asked us to move to the bar because they needed the table for the next guests.

The Shrimp and Crawfish Croquettes are a can't miss appetizer and the fried oyster salad is very reliable, too. Frying oysters is pretty difficult, but they do it just right. The Filet Mignon has also been very good when I've had it. A very thick cut and cooked precisely as I've ordered it. Can't complain about the service, either. The only MINOR thing I can think of is the possibility of a loud dining room. If the place is packed or if there is a rowdy table the intimacy can be zapped out of the room pretty fast.

You tell people it's priced lower and they buy more?  Instead, I'm willing to pay full price but then they discount the item(s) at the register... don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to pay less but if I knew it was on sale I might have bought more items or more of the same item.

The Fish Tacos were amazing, the fish was super fresh and the toppings had a beautiful light zesty and savory flavor. The flavors were very well balanced and even the sides were amazing. It came with some savory beans, cajunish rice, pickled slaw and guacamole. The fish was very fresh, no pungent smell or taste, flaky and beautifully seasoned. The Blondie was heaven, it wasn't overtly sweet and the icecream was velvety. My friend had the Molly Ringwald cocktail and it was just refreshing (I had a taste of course).

This may be my new favorite pizza place in the city.   The service was good, the pizza was not expensive and the crust was....just amazing. It reminds me of those Pizza Hut stuffed crust commercials from the past, that told you to eat the crust first. This crust is totally worthy of the ""eat first"" treatment. The rest of the 'za was also pretty good, but just icing next to that delicious delicious crust.  And, even better, it was cheap!

Every hour should be happy hour IMO.  But we stayed because we were too lazy and thirsty to trek anywhere else.   The variety of beers on tap was impressive. The space was a bit small but they also have an upstairs space with it's own bar. There was a dog friendly area outside, which I look forward to utilizing in the spring.

Being a resident of the Marigny and thrilled with the new restaurant scene developing in the Bywater, I was excited about the concept of this restaurant and so wanted to like it. First off, even if you'd never been to any of these places and sampled the street food the menu touts , I still think that the food is disappointing. Unfortunately, i have actually eaten a lot of the authentic street food abroad, and Booty's renditions don't even come close! Begging the question- have the chefs or owners of Booty's ever been to these places or do they just watch the Travel Channel a lot? However, the renovation is impressive and will even look better with l little age on it- ( if they can manage to stay open that long) and the drinks are interesting and fairly fun. I wish I could chalk the whole bad experience up to ordering badly, but two of the dishes that I ordered were on the recommendation of the server- the rice balls and the empanada. One quick note that must be said, the Ramen- really? egg noodles the size of fettuccine? and you call that pork broth? I'm pretty sure I cracked the code for that recipe- soy sauce, water and maybe a bit of sugar. As a lover of authentic Japanese Ramen, I was totally offended. Here's a little tip, his month's Bon Appetit  has a great photo of what real ramen should be, check it out boys, you don't even have to Japan! I could go on, but it would just be unnecessarily mean. Because I am the eternal optimist when it comes to new restaurants, especially those in my Hood, as disappointed as I am I will probably go back. The vibe was great and I would like to see them ultimately succeed, but next time I will stick to the fries and drinks.",Restaurants

I ordered a small cold brew with vanilla, easy on the ice. I added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread (the bread butt; the best part!) to my order and paid with a credit card. They have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase.   I topped off my drink with whole milk -- which in itself was a real treat. It's so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station!   Before leaving, I asked what else they had in the way of a GF offering, and the young man behind the counter said ""just the zucchini bread."" That's a real bummer; the zucchini bread is great but I'd love to have more than one option.   My drink was smooth and had a perfect flavor. I was happy with my choices.

I provided the full name and number plus the expiration and CVV. Then waited.. Called at the hour and ten minute mark to inquire as to the status of my order and was told it would be there in 10 minutes.  40 minutes later I finally received a phone call saying that my order was at the door. The delivery man was there standing there with a lit cigarette and said that he got lost. I'm not sure if I would have received any notice of the food taking so long had I not called myself.

It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues.  To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town.  Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that.  Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong.  Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you 'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you.  We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch.  There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it.  My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.

We had a 12 person table there to see a football game and they would not change the channel because an uninterested woman asked before us to see another game. She was not even watching it until we asked to change it.   The manager would not change it because he said it was first come, first serve.

I hate going to French Quarter they are over priced and just overall suck. Visions is nearly all locals, and secluded enough to feel comfortable. There parking lot is huge and well lighted and have security that not only watch the front doors but watch over the parking lot. Good not to worry some crack head or a hole is breaking into my car while i am watching some boobs. Back in the day they had stools so they were comfortable, but they decided to replace them with fixed chairs that don't swivel so your forced to either stand or sit facing the bar. I understand why they choose to fix the chairs to not move many guys would just sit there with there backs to the girls taking up valuable space. But the chairs are not the most comfortable. They added two more lap dance rooms, one is more private then the old open room that had  4 to 8 girls giving lap dances at one time. Not sure about the VIP one but many smiles came out from that one. They fixed up the bathroom, feels like a luxury hotel men's room. The time before last they had a guy working in there but nobody this last time.  Drinks are ok, usually $5 per mix or beer, The mix drinks are a little small and week for me but i like to drink. The bartenders are usually pretty cool and remember your face and which drink you want and get it to you pretty fast. As to the girls ( The main reason your there ) it varies like every other strip club. You will see the hot ones the not so hot ones, the sexy ones and the trashy ones. Best way to describe "" to each his own is beautiful"". I never felt pressured to get lap dances or buy ( Warm Shots ) from the shot girls. Overall i think this strip club is the best one around because you can feel comfortable, have a good time, not spend your entire paycheck, and go home safe feeling you had a good time. Ow i almost forgot when i got there they had a guy on the side selling food from a massive smoker. I was hungry when i left so i got a plate and for $10 bucks the food was damn good.

My girlfriend had Red Beans and Rice and added some grilled chicken and I had the Blackened Red Fish which came with really good green beans and a roasted potato mix. The food was delicious, better than any other Creole place I've tried, it seems worth the full menu price. We also shared a Voodoo Juice which tasted pretty good and felt kind of strong. The only thing we had wished is if there was a side salad option. Unfortunately the meal was too large for my girlfriend and our hotel didn't have a fridge and microwave so a lot went to waste.  For dessert, the server (Cliffton I believe) had given us a complimentary bread pudding and we ordered a key lime pie, both to go. We ate them later at the hotel room and they were both very good, the key lime pie was more like a layered cream cake, it was very tasty. Overall, the service was excellent and the food was amazing, I can't recommend it enough for a nice evening meal in the French Quarter.",Restaurants

I ordered the shrimp pasta, i kept it simple.   One other ordered the fried oyster salad.   And the other got the special of the day which i believe was some type of fish.   Everything was superb. The owner (Basem, very nice guy) even came out and gave one of my friends fresh, bigger oysters because he felt that they ""weren't big enough""  as if the delicious food wasn't enough, then this.

The d√©cor is very inviting.  The owner has hired a very friendly staff and attentive manager who checked in with my table during each visit. The restaurant can get loud if the bar is busy (typically during Saints games), but a big plus is that the bar is smoke-free since it is connected to the dining room.    The food...where do I start?  I really enjoyed the sesame barbeque salmon with corn maque choux and warm Creole potato salad (so much that I ordered twice out of my three visits).  I recently took my parents to the restaurant and my mom loved the salmon dish as well (and to you gluten-free people out there, the dish is gf and the chef is very willing to accommodate).  Between my husband and other guests we have tried most menu items and everyone has been pleased with both seafood and non-seafood entrees.

653,Little Tokyo Japanese Restaurant,29.9761485,-90.098716,17.0,"This part of Carrollton needs more restaurants like this.  Hell, the whole city could use more restaurants like this.  The atmosphere is modern and tasteful, dark, cool, and pleasant, though the design seems to be trying a little too hard for cool.  That's not really a bad thing; it's endearing rather than offensive (If it matters, they seem to have gotten the music thing under control.  Again, it's more funny than off-putting).  If you can't be bothered to read the whole review, I'll give you the takeaway message right now: order a big Sapporo draft (or Kirin Ichiban if that's your thing) and a couple or three of the small plates.  You will enjoy it.  Bring friends so you can trade bits of the appetizers.  If you're still hungry, order some of the killer noodles.  Maybe the sushi's good, maybe it isn't.  I haven't bothered to find out because the rest of it is great.  Detail-wise: the gyoza are rich, redolent little pockets of juicy flavor that come with a great citrus sauce for dipping.  It's not the overpowering raw soy flavor most places give you.  The takoyaki are intriguing, with an internal texture that's somewhere between a pancake and a set custard, spiked with bits of meaty, chewy octopus and topped with the deep ocean funk of katsuoboshi.  The seaweed salad is redolent of sesame oil and has a satisfying crunch.  Also, try some of the fried skewers.  I got the pork, which was crunchy on the outside and came with tonkatsu sauce, which is sort of what you'd get if barbecue sauce and ketchup gave birth to a talented and delicious child.  I can't imagine that they're any less talented at skewering and frying (or grilling) other things.  And if you're still hungry, there are noodles in abundance, and good noodles.  The ramen, if you're used to packets, will be revelatory (though it's not the best I've ever had, I eat it happily).  It's rich and filling, coming in head-sized bowls.  Even better is the yakisoba, a hot fried noodle dish that came out steaming and savory, with the meaty, slightly charred flavor that would, in Chinese cuisine, be called wok hee.  It's like what you wish lo mein could be.  The food's great, the beer is cold and appropriate to the food.  There are even karaoke rooms you can rent.  What's not to like?",Restaurants
2741,Riverstone Gallery--Riverwalk Mall,29.94851,-90.062946,19.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into this mall. They have a few high end stores and those stores have GREAT sales. I bought 2 shirts at Neiman Marcus that are normally $138 dollars each and I got them both for $125. These aren't out of season clothes either. Plus, the mall is HUGE, it doesn't look like it from the outside, but it has a ton of stores in it. For those of you who are Tommy Bahama fans, well, there is a store in there and everything is 50% off, and lets just say you will just go a little crazy in there. I ended up getting 5 pairs of shorts and 5 shirts to match. So, I would suggest going in there with the mindset that you are in fact going to spend some money because you aren't going to be able to pass up the great deals!",Shopping
828,Merchant,29.952739,-90.0711728,15.0,"OMG I love this place. So much so that I cannot believe I haven't written a review for it yet. What a slacker I've been! For shame. Merchant is totally the venue of my dreams when it comes to a place I can go if I need to get out of the house and work. It has EVERYTHING.  All the other coffee shops and bars I frequent for quality time with my laptop have one or more failings - small tables, too few outlets, inconvenient hours, inconvenient location, no caffeine, no booze, crappy wifi. However, Merchant has everything I could want from a coffee shop. And then some. First of all, the space is gorgeous. I feel like I'm in another city, somewhere in Europe, because the design is very, well, designed. In a good way. You'll see what I mean when you step inside.   The coffee they serve, Illy, is a fantastic brand. High octane and delicious. And perfectly prepared by extremely friendly, helpful and customer-oriented staff. Everyone I've encountered at Merchant has been a delight, which is certainly not always the case at most places.  In addition to great coffee, they serve food (I've had breakfast, lunch AND dinner there by now, since they're open all day until 8pm), and although I haven't tried it yet, I know they serve booze (because what else could ""grapes"" stand for in the ""Coffee, Crepes, Grapes"" that serves as their tagline). Speaking of crepes, I'm so glad to have somewhere other than the places Uptown to get a nutella filled crepe when I have a craving. All places should sell nutella crepes, but that's another story.  So. Merchant has coffee, food, booze, and ambiance. The attention to detail is apparent in the way the tables are set up in the corridor area (just off the main bar where you place your order), because each table has power outlets next to it on the floor, and there are potted plants that serve as dividers between the tables, which afford some privacy if you're there for a meeting (or just don't like people staring at you when you're hunched over the computer, posting status updates to Facebook about how you should really be working). The wifi connection is good, in my experience. On top of all that, the tables themselves are large, so you've got plenty of room even if you've got coffee, plates of food, and two laptops spread out in front of you. Which I know because I've tried this.   Cannot tell you how happy I am to have found THE perfect coffee shop for the freelancer who sometimes wants to be around people (instead of cats) and wear real clothes (instead of pajamas). This is definitely a place I can spend hours and hours being productive, without having to leave for food/coffee/functioning internet, etc. Hooray for Merchant!

We went in to happy hour which was a great deal. 3 of their house cocktails are $4 and several of their ""snack"" items are $4 from 4-7 pm daily. We ordered the blue cheese and chili fries, their oyster & bacon dip, and their mini corn dog style shrimp.   It was all just a touch off. Remnants of Besh still remain but in an obvious cost saving manner: example the shrimp comes with an apricot mustard served in a tiny cast iron crock from the Besh days, but the crock is too wide and not deep enough to effectively dunk the shrimp like you would a corn dog. The oysters in the dip were minced and the bacon was undetectable - it was a tasty dip but not what we were expecting. The fries were pixie cut from the freezer. They could have been fried a bit longer as they came out anemic and the menu was deceptive!! At first I thought they'd be chili cheese fries. When I re read the menu I realized they would have roasted chilis and blue cheese. The dish that came out was fries covered in crumbled bleu cheese and scallions with an oil sauce that had a hint of peppers on the side. We were unsure if we were supposed to dip the fries or pour it over them, but decided to use the fries to eat the rest of the not quite oyster dip.  We did not order any entrees as the prices have jumped to $18-30 per plate and the snacks were not so great that they invited us to spend that kind of money there.  The ambience remains unchanged and the staff were quick and friendly. We'll probably stop in for a drink but will likely give our food business to the soda shop next time we visit the WWII museum.

As I approach the counter I see a sign taped to the debit card swipe machine but the sign has flipped backwards and cannot be seen from a distance. So, I stood in the short line and finally when it was my turn I had to pretty much lift the sign up in order to read it because it was not visible otherwise. The sign of course said NO CASH BACK. At this point I was slightly annoyed because why not!!!  So I asked the person working and she said she would be able to give me $20. Well when I went to swipe my card the option for up to $40 came up and I almost allowed my finger to press it but I didn't. I just go $20.   I'm not sure why this CVS is making up it's own rules about giving cash back. It seems as though the CVS policy is to allow up to $40. But to just put up a sign to dissuade people from getting cash back makes me more than bothered. There are no banks in the immediate area and there are no other options except going into the grocery store that shares the parking lot. That section of the parking lot is more crowded and it takes more time to get in line at a grocery store just to get cash back. This CVS is doing this community a disservice.",Shopping

All display models are powered via battery or plug and even one that recharges like phone through a usb cord.  Once the remodeling and the shop are complete, I can only imagine how amazing this place will be.  The private appointment was perfect for the first-timer in our group and she felt completely at ease asking questions (the other two of us felt the same way.)  I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a progressive, lady-friendly sex boutique.  They sell safe products - not the cheap toxic ones you find everywhere else in the city.  There is no pressure to buy anything, but we could not help ourselves and all three of us left with bags containing multiple items.  We met with Hope and I can tell you from experience you can ask her just about anything and she will answer without any judgment.  She really believes in educating and empowering women and is an asset to this city.  Their prices are very reasonable for the product you get and well worth it.  I believe they do pop-up shops while they are finishing the remodel and I highly encourage anyone - especially those who are new or too nervous, shy or embarrassed to visit the type of shop you typically find in New Orleans - to go check them out.

It's a nice change from the majority of other venues in the area which are very crowded with standing-room-only.  We had a great server who asked our food/drink preferences and constructed a whole meal for us, including the BBQ sliders, shrimp and grits, and creole cream cheesecake.

Most of her sandwiches have some form of ham and cheese in them, but my wife asks Donna to leave the ham off hers, and Donna always comes through with something good.  I like the food here enough that I eat her stuff probably twice to three times per week.  Everything I've ordered had melted cheese and tasty sauces that made me happy, and usually elicited comments from the people around me in the office or in the cafeteria.  ""Hey WHAT is that smell?""  ""Where can I get a sandwich like that?""  ""I've been watching you eating that thing, and I just have to know where you got it!""  Every time I bring one back to work i get comments like these.  The only issue I've heard people state about A Fork In The Road is that in order to produce these delicious sandwiches Donna has to take five to ten minutes per sandwich, and since her press can accommodate only two sandwiches, she can't - and won't - rush her creations.  Do not come to Donna with a ten-sandwich order at the height of the lunch rush, but if you're willing to wait a few minutes for a really delicious sandwich, come see Donna.

Then the security guard walked to f and ms and we thought he was trying to tell the people at f and ms not to let us in. F and ms let us in bc they have great workers who actually know how to check an ID. Moral of the story is that for some unknown reason Gritz decided not to let my legal friend into their bar, but most importantly the doorman and security guard were being assholes. The security guard has a huge ego and believes he has the same authority as an actual cop. I love f and ms and I appreciate its ability to respectfully accept all people into its bar that are over  21. But Gritz is a whole different story. I witnessed Gritz disrespect one of my best friends in a way that no one should be disrespected. I am still confused as to why this bar denied entry to my legal friend.

The restaurant itself is as gorgeous as ever, a gem of a fine dining establishment. There was a bit of a crowd, so it wasn't empty which is  a good thing. I can't stand sitting in an empty restaurant. The service was good to above average.   The $19.20 menu provides a few choices for each course. We both ordered the crab and shrimp cake for an appetizer. It was outstanding, one of the better appetizers I have had in a long time. I ordered the short ribs which were good but not great. The sauce was nice and the presentation was nice with a big Portobello on top which was tasty. But the short ribs were cut in pieces and were found under a mound of mashed potatoes. Nothing at all bad about the dish, it just didn't wow. My lovely better half ordered the fish ( drum I think) with tropical fruit salsa and coconut rice, a much better choice. It was very well prepared, especially the execution of the fish which was perfectly moist, cooked just right. For dessert, I ordered chocolate ice cream which consisted of a very tiny, kid's portion (not much more than a tablespoon )of very good ice cream accompanied by about a teaspoon of whipped cream. The better half again ordered better and got the peanut butter mousse which was a much larger portion and excellent, outstanding in fact.  So if you're looking for a nice evening at a grand restaurant but don't want to break the bank, come to Broussard's for good meal and overall dining experience during the $19.20 special.

2423,Casa Pelican B&B and Cooking School,29.9534746,-90.0485381,18.0,"We visited New Orleans for a week recently, and had the pleasure to stay with Chef Karen at her B&B. We also took advantage of the opportunity to  take two of her cooking classes.   The cooking classes: Chef Karen isn't just a great cook, she is an excellent teacher. Her classes are as hands-on as you're willing to make them. Her stated goal is to demonstrate and then step away from the kitchen. Your group of 4-8 students will do all of the prep work and then rotate through the actual cooking of multiple local classics. Chef Karen will guide you through the steps, and explain exactly what you're doing and why. She will describe not only what you are looking for as you cook, but also what you are tasting and smelling for! My wife and I have already prepared an authentic jambalaya since our return home, with the recipe and skills we learned in Chef Karen's kitchen. We felt truly prepared by her teachings. I would unreservedly recommend her classes if you get to New Orleans and can spare one afternoon/evening for an immersive experience.  The B&B: A charming home in the Algiers Point neighborhood, just across the river from the French Quarter, Casa Pelican has two bedrooms available for rental. Our room was comfortable and homey, with our own bathroom. The air conditioning was a wonderful counter to the 90+ degree summer heat. Breakfasts were homemade, delicious, and plentiful. The best thing about the place, though, is Karen. She is the warmest and friendliest person, and she opens her home to her guests as if they are friends, not just customers. She is so willing to engage with you in conversation, and she is a fount of information about the area, the culture, and of course the food.   We found this situation to be terrific, but I think it wouldn't necessarily be right for everyone. Some small caveats: - As mentioned on their listing, Case Pelican is an older house with a relatively steep and narrow stairway up to the bedrooms. It wasn't a problem at all for us, but if you aren't comfortable getting your bags up a narrow flight of stairs, this might be a problem. - It's not difficult to get from Casa Pelican to the French Quarter, but it is about a ten minute walk to the ferry (a five minute ride) and then a few minutes to get into the SW edge of the FQ.  (The ferry runs every 30 minutes until 9:45pm midweek and 11:45 on weekends.) Totally doable, but it means it's not convenient to drop back to the room midday for a rest, or in the evening to shower and change before you head to a nice dinner. It also means you're going to have additional walking on both ends of your day.  With that in mind, I have to say that my wife and I feel like now we have a great friend in New Orleans and we really couldn't imagine heading back there and NOT staying at Casa Pelican with Chef Karen. And head back there we will.",Shopping

You had a group of normal people there (some of whom work long hours at stressful, dangerous jobs and rarely get the chance to relax with their families) who were totally respectful to you.

I tried to be as friendly as possible and ask questions and he just grunted at me while continuing to watch videos on his phone. I asked him if he knew of any other places and basically refused to answer or even look at me. So we just turned around and walked away. It was extremely awkward and uncomfortable. Thankfully he was really the only ridiculously unfriendly person that we had come in contact with it in Nola during our stay.

Also one of the DJs playing there messed up a few times when I was there - not cool  There is not a lot of room in the main section, and it's hard to move around... really packed, you can't move in any direction at all. The location of the men's bathroom forces you to cut through all the seating booths along one side of the main room... kind of annoying  The whole thing does stay open really late, which is cool, and the side section usually has more room to wander. There is also a ""hallway"" that you walk through to get in which is outdoors, and you can hang out there and chat or cool off.  Location is kind of random.

It's the type of dish you want to have another of as soon as you finish eating it. Sometimes in a dish like this you get lotsa the extras and only a little of the featured item. Not here; there was LOTS of salmon!  Decided to splurge and also get the Roasted Bone Marrow with pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes and watermelon radish slices, as you don't often see this on menus. Not only was it very very good but (a) unlike some places where you just get the marrow and some bread or, in this case, baguette slices, here the pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes, watermelon radish slices and, a goodly amount of, I believe, dill, fleshed it out wonderfully & imaginatively and (b) for a change, there was a pleasingly plentiful amount of baguette slices so I didn't have to ask for more. Bone marrow may not be to everyone's taste...which just means more for me!!  Crispy Pork Chop (grilled corn, mint, cucumber, avocado, buttermilk, watermelon molasses) Crispy it was; I actually thought it was too crispy, but hadn't realized that was what it was billed as--though I wouldn't've minded it being a little more tender/moister, I guess you can't complain about something for being what it's supposed to be. That said, the watermelon molasses (the brown swirl around the pork chop) was so yummy it should be sold in sex shops for people to spread all over their partner's body after which it can be licked off. Lol Seriously, I asked my server for more of it and covered that part of the chop that wasn't already covered with the buttermilk. I don't think I licked its ramekin...but I sure wanted to!   Salted Caramel Budino (orange and pistachio)  I wasn't familiar with the budino concept and, while I enjoy caramel, the pleasures of the ""Salted"" part always escape me; once I got to the pudding beneath the caramel topping, however, I didn't want it to end!  I also had a very nice, and nicely priced, glass of the Syrah/Cinsault/Grenache rose. Light, refreshing, not too dry and with a nice bouquet, it was just what I was in the mood for.  About the only glitch was when I asked the ma√Ætre d' if he could turn up the light a little bit as it was awfully dark at my table; it didn't seem like it would be a big deal as the lights had momentarily bumped up just before. He came back a few minutes later saying that ""the manager was busy"" so apparently he couldn't do anything about it. I understand that staffing there is a little crazy due to COVID challenges but this hadn't seemed like a biggie. He did offer to move me to another table but by then I had settled in so declined. Not a biggie but it would've been nice to better see my food.  I understand that due to COVID craziness, most of The Bower's menu (the cheese and charcuterie boards) is currently from its adjacent bistro, Claret. When things return to normal, I was told that The Bower's options would expand offering more entrees along the lines of what I had. Can't wait!",Restaurants

I think the prices start on those at about $20 and up, mostly in the $25-$35 range.    Pretty reasonably priced accessories too! An assortment of tights for about $6 and fun vintage earrings (about $14 and under). Many are clip ons and you just might see the same pair on a drag queen.   My friend and I were basically having a small heart attack every aisle we turned at seeing the next fun thing.

All seating options come with perhaps the most copious amount of power outlets I've ever seen. You could have 10 devices to charge and you'd be fine.  Employees were exceptionally friendly. Even though my iced tea was ~$2, they informed me that there were free refills and even told me what time they closed. It's such a small detail, but I thought that was pretty GGG of the dude. While leaving, another employee made sure to get my attention asking me to 'have a nice day.' This is a friendly place.

The general consensus has become that it should never take more than a couple minutes to make a Cuba Libre - even if you have a handlebar mustache and are wearing suspenders while doing it. The two stars here is for the pellet ice that does make up the majority of the cocktail. Good stuff. Didn't try the food and was not impressed by what I saw on the menu.

This would mean a trip from my main residence to Florida, but I was willing to accommodate in order to get the painting repaired. By this time the paint had started to disappear, either flaking off or completely absorbing into the fencing. There was a short-lived alternative plan whereby the owner would pick up the painting on her way through Sarasota to or from Miami, take it back to New Orleans, and then ship it back to us. After a very long time of negotiations, she notified me that I would have to ship the painting (I have no idea how would I would go about that) to her and she would have the artist repair it, but I would have to pay for the artist to reapply the paint, which by now is disappearing.

It all started with one cute top--a friend dragged me in there, promising adorable clothing that would hug my curves (I'm an hourglass size 6-8 and rarely do I find flattering clothing in department stores). I ended up getting my wedding dress, shoes, corset and accessories from them. Though their day dresses are pricier than mass-market fare, if you take proper care of them (dryclean only or at most handwash cold) they will last and flatter you for years and years. For my wedding attire, I still ended up paying hundreds less than ladies who opt to go to one of those wedding-in-a-box stores. Plus I can wear those heels and gorgeous, floor-length red dress over and over.  As for those who have had unfriendly experiences, keep in mind that Candice, the owner and designer, has extensive experience with the European market and models the store after the European (especially Parisian) style of shopping. The salesladies aren't there to be chummy and will not give you much attention unless it appears that you are serious about a purchase or about putting an outfit together. Then they will give you their undivided attention and suggest ways of pairing garments and accessories. They will not lie and tell you something fits when it doesn't. They will, however, make sure they do whatever is needed to make the piece look right for you, including finding the right size, helping you lace a corset or shoes, or running to the back to get stays or pins.  They did just that when I went in for my wedding outfit. I also appreciate that they gave me ample time to examine every piece. Their no-exchange policy is strict, but if you're seriously going to pay $450 for a dress, you are allowed to take your time and examine it in thorough detail. You might drop some serious cash in a visit, but you will feel and look amazing--and you will wear these numbers time and time again (and yes, men and women alike *will* complement you). Their line is the ultimate in classy, sexy elegance!",Shopping

What a mistake!  When we finally sat down to eat here on one of our last days in town we realized we could have been happy scarfing there every morning!  The omelets were tasty, I loved the hash browns (the grits not so much, but thats the northerner in me perhaps!) and the lite menu (egg whites, turkey bacon.. it was a platter but I can't remember the name) was a hit with our family who were on a diet for the trip.

At this point I stop by every once in a while to purchase little things for filling in or replacing items that have either burned in the summer heat or froze.    Here is a typical trip for me: first I always hit the herbs section for a little looky-look.  I like collecting new varieties of herbs I don't have yet, for example I currently have several types of mint growing just about everywhere (lavender mint, orange mint, variegated mint, chocolate mint).  Mint is wonderful here because it will grow dense in a pot, it will hang over a planter beautiful, and it will just grow legs and stretch itself all over your flower beds.  When you walk by if you just run your hand through it, you will have the scent everywhere.  I also have a beautiful variegated basil that I love and lemon grass that the doggies love to chew on.  The price is great on herbs (under $2 each, and I have gotten a lot of millage out of all of my selections.  This spring I decided to plant a flower bed that was dedicated to butterflies.  I purchased some pintas and some blood flowers.  For a while I thought my garden was unsuccessful.  Some of the pintas died from heat (they would normally be fine, but these are planted by the pool and the radiant heat over there is intense, typically I try to keep the umbrella open so my flowers don't get burned, but my neighbor is an asshole and always puts the umbrella down so death to my plants) I digress... anyway a couple of weeks ago I come out and all of the leaves and flowers on the blood flowers were eaten, but then I noticed a chrysalis and then several more!  SUCCESS now I have monarch butterflies everywhere.  Yesterday I stopped by and purchased a few snap dragons to put some color around and a new rosemary for the giant one that mysteriously died this summer.

Let me start by saying the girl who waited on me couldn't have been either nicer or more polite.  I arrived at 10:30 and ordered 5 spicy chicken tenders.  I totally expected there to be a wait since they had just opened.  I pulled around, paid and then was asked to back up by the cashier at the window.  I have been asked to pull forward many times at other places when the food was going to take a while but this was a first for me. She wanted me to back up at least 15 feet.  As I sat in the car waiting to be summoned back to the window, I decided that I could not let this girl off the hook and planned to ask why this bizarre request was asked of me.  All I could think of was someone pulling up behind me and thinking that I was a complete idiot for stopping short of the window when there were no cars in front of me.  Believe me, I love using my horn and I would have honked at me.  After about 5 minutes, she reached out of the window and waved at me to pull forward.  When I asked her why I had to pull up, she told me that they would get a bad rating if I had to wait too long at the window for my food.  Really????????  I was so amused at her total lack of understanding of what she had just divulged to me, but I refused to call to complain for fear she may lose her job (FYI, for you Popeye's people, this was a few months ago).  Personally I think it is idiotic to place such pressure on people not even earning a living wage.  As everyone knows, fast food is not always fast.  I would much rather wait for hot, fresh food than be served something sitting under an orange light for one hour because these people cooked way too much chicken out of fear that the drive-thru timer police were coming to get them.

1010,The Daily Beet,29.923227,-90.0878542,18.0,"From a stand in St Roch to a corner shop downtown, The Daily Beet has now expanded Uptown, with a sunny new location and a slightly different menu. It's a sort of counterculture in New Orleans in that it offers healthy food that might be best described as ""flexitarian""; not 100% vegetarian but you can pretty much certainly eat there regardless of your diet. They don't have anything fried, and most of it is based around fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And most importantly, it's delicious.  Among my few sources of disappointment were my discovery that despite the fact that their breakfast is offered ""all day"", the thing I really wanted to order, pancakes, is only offered until 2:00, which is not all day. However, there was plenty else on the menu to try, and my ""chimi chimi"" bowl yielded a hearty quinoa-based salad with avocado and feta and pumpkin seeds. Plenty of substance. I also went for an almond-based smoothie. It took a while, and frankly they seemed a bit confused on the service end, but it delivered the full mix of sweet and nutty flavors I'd hoped for when it arrived.  The food is eclectic and not overly specific to New Orleans or any other culture, but frankly this place strikes me as the way I should be eating. The main reason I don't visit the other Daily Beets more is that the locations aren't that convenient to me, despite them being open seven days and for generous hours.

1991,Bayou Bar,29.9351203,-90.0798108,4.0,"This is a great bar.  Located on the ground floor of the historic Pontchartrain Hotel, I would have never known about this bar if it weren't for Yelp (Thanks Marielle S.).   The bar has a very cool atmosphere. The wall and bar area is adorned with paintings of Louisiana bayou scenes done by a famous local artist. Apparently the large painting on the wall is insured for a million dollars. This seems a bit odd since people can sit next to it and rest their head on the wall, but it is a very cool painting.  The bar feels very fancy, because of the history surrounding it, but doesn't feel pretentious. I think I would be comfortable here dressed up, or in casual clothes. Not many bars can accomplish the fancy, yet laid back vibe.  Service was very good. The bartender was friendly and showed great skill at making ultra fancy drinks. The selection of beer was admirable, including Nola Irish Channel Stout on draft.  I really liked this bar and hope to come back soon. If you are looking for a laid back, yet fancy bar with great history, check out the Bayou Bar. You won't be disappointed.",Restaurants

I love how each bar mixes the flavors themselves so everything is fresh. The bartender was REALLY nice and talkative.

We ordered wine and drinks which took about 15 minutes to arrive. After the drinks were out the waiter took our order which included an appetizer , salad and 4 entrees. We then had to wait for 35 minutes for our appetizers and salad to come out. The waiter must have forgotten to put them in because 4 minutes after they were put down our entrees came out.  Everyone liked their food (I had the hanger steak which was cooked well and came with great pomme frites). Even though we all annoyed with the service, We forged ahead and ordered dessert which took about 20 minutes to come out. The dessert was good. We tried 4 different ones, and all split. I recommend the pear and apple desserts, both were scrumptious. By the time we got done and paid our check the meal had taken over 2 hours which is ridiculous in my opinion.  There was only 1 server for the whole restaurant, so maybe that's why the service was terrible.

It was my wife's birthday and we had a party for her.  I'd gotten bouquets from Dunn & Sonnier a couple of times in the past for her.  Every arrangement I purchased was exquisite and fresh, so I didn't feel the need to go there and explain what I wanted, I just asked them to arrange something wonderful for my price point.  The arrangement was gorgeous; not what I'd expected, but still lovely and my wife thought they were beautiful.  I can't recall the flowers used, but they were white.  The next day we noticed they'd begun to brown a bit and by evening, they were mostly browned out.  They'd been kept cool and fresh until I placed them on the table for the party.  My wife was disappointed and called Dunn & Sonnier and explained what had happened.  They apologized and asked that we send a photo of the arrangement.  My wife did this and they said absolutely this was unacceptable and said that the next time we wanted an arrangement that they would take care of it!  True customer service!  We weren't at all looking for that, we just wanted to make sure they knew that this happened in the event it happened again to someone else.  So our anniversary came up recently and I called Dunn & Sonnier and explained the situation.  With no trouble whatsoever, they got me another arrangement, more beautiful than the first.  And they lasted over a week, which is all I ask for - give me 5 days of beauty!    Dunn & Sonnier didn't have to do that, but they did because they understand the customer's desires.  The service is quick and easy, they deliver and the folks there are very friendly and helpful.  They are my florists and I will send everyone I know there!",Shopping
